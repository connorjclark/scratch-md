Create a new thread to request a feature!

Or at the very least, have it so that combos such as lock blocks can work like regular locked doors in that they set the unlocked door status for the screen in the approprate dicretion.  It could be done through scripts, but it would be easier to add as a combo.

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 22:35

I am a little unclear what universal locked doors means

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 22:36

Are we talking about a lockblock combo you can place anywhere that just unlocks that one combo, permanently? That sounds useful but also maybe a bit tough to implement

Bug Report: In Mystical Harps, the following three screens have a LOT in common, and they all throw a very big error. Picking up any item on them will cause string 65 to be played. They all have the same shop, same string, (possibly) same guy, and two of the same flags set Item Falls From Ceiling, and Hold Up Item.

yes, one of the items to which this situation responded did not have any scripts on it, even the janky ass old pickup timer scripts. I had both scripts cleared and this still happened.

## Blackout Fade options for specific warps (#800)

=== @ Mitsukara 08/18/2021 03:54

Currently ZC supports multiple types of black opening wipe (also used by Entrance/Exit combos). These include rectangles from the sides (Z1), Circle, Oval (LTTP), spinning Triangle, and Super Mario All-Stars (tiles).

However, they're set up to work quest-wide with quest rules. It would be neat to be able to set each specific warp to use a specific type of fade. (also to be able to do it without relying on entrance/exit combo warps specifically would be nice, since those mess with continue points). Perhaps a fade in / fade out option on each warp combo somehow? Whatever works.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/18/2021 03:58

^sfx too

=== @ Mitsukara 08/18/2021 04:04

ooooh yes, a sfx that doesn't get interrupted by the warp would be awesome

=== @ Mitsukara 11/19/2021 09:03

Reviving this one to add some additional ideas.

- The "static"-y effect from the darkness dithering which clears the screen
- A black rectangle that covers the screen from left to right.

also I didn't clarify this before, but it would be really neat to be able to manually set a fade-in for arriving at a warp, so that you can have it fade out when you leave, then reliably fade in when you arrive (currently this only works on certain kinds of warps, I think maybe Entrance/Exit warps or caves?).

As for current ZC version, Clock item cannot stop time without rendering Link invincible at the same time, unlike Castlevania. Here is the link to ancient PureZC forum thread about my futile attempts to do proper time stopping item script.

=== @ P-Tux7 08/18/2021 06:13

while we're at it
can we make the clock attributes script-writable
link's invincibility and the time stopping (both with args for how much, 0 being "infinite until further notice")
so that if you want a "inventory clock" item you don't have to spawn a literal clock on top of link

=== @ Alucard648 08/18/2021 07:17

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "while we're at it"): 1. Already possible in 2.55 a92
2. I like idea of separate durations.
3. As for Stopwatch, it could keep as is (spawning clocks on top of Link). And add function to check if time id stopped or running.

=== @ Dr00g 08/20/2021 20:31

i think the idea of Crystal Switches that affect a combo in a whole Dmap is kinda cool without the use of a bunch of Secret flags,  So like a combo is Crstal A and B and then Crystal block A, B C and D for diffrent colors raised and lowered

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 21:52

You could just have an animated combo for the sparkles
either have the switch combo itself have them, or have a switch block combo on a layer above the switch (switch block so it changes color of sparkle based on the switch state)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 21:54

the problem being, we don't know exactly what your switch combo will look like, so it wouldn't look the best without a number of ways to configure it... which then clutters up the combo options for one visual feature

=== @ bigjoe 08/20/2021 21:55

ive already solved it with a script, so you can mark this as "better off with a script" I guess. I was just thinking with future LTTP designers in mind

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 21:55

@ Mitsukara for the sword, that probably would be doable, just similarly to arrow sparkles, on a flag, using a weapon sprite from the sprite list. Make a separate thread for that?
(replying to @ bigjoe "ive already solved it with a‚Ä¶"): My point being you don't even need a script, just an animated combo

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 21:56

In LTTP, Link's sword creatse sparkles (basically LW_SPARKLE) which move up the tip of Link's sword while charging / sit in front of the tip when charged, and then his spin attack also creates sparkles around the sword. 

Some approximation of this, creation LW_SPARKLES on the LW_SWORD during LA_CHARGING and LA_SPINNING, would be a neat option in-engine (though it's not that hard to do with scripts, so low priority).

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 22:00

^ More priority to this, because it resolves a major issue of 8-bit sword sprites not being able to display charge progress

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 22:01

In LTTP, Link's sword creates sparkles which move up the tip as he charges, then appear near the front of the tip when charged, and then continues to make sparkles around the sword during the spin attack.

Something similar could be achieved by creating LW_SPARKLEs on the LA_SWORD during LA_CHARGING and then during LA_SPINNING, which would be neat. (Although this can be mostly handled by scripts, scripts have no way of telling how far along the charge progress is so you can't really do the move-forward-on-the-blade effect). Alternatively you could wait for the sparkles to appear at all until charging is done.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 22:01

would use an item flag to enable, and a `Sprites[]` sprite for the sparkle

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 22:02

Ah, whatever works
it is worth noting the position of the sparkles shifts a bit. The ones on the tip seem to move from side to side a bit.

When you change DMap palettes via side-warp, the level CSets fade to black and fade back in on the next screen.  Requesting a QR to apply this to all CSets (except 6)
this prevents the following from happening with combos in sprite CSets:

=== @ Jennette ‚ù£ 08/22/2021 12:32

This could have several behaviors that are seen in official Zelda games.

For starters:

Shooting through it with an arrow could give it fire properties

As well, if a torch combo is on screen it could make a screen count as "lighted" in the context of dark rooms. This could be helpful for a variety of reasons, such as if people don't want the candle itself to provide light, if they want temporary light from lit torches or if they want a screen where you have to light torches to permanently light it up.

also, it's a bad script

=== @ P-Tux7 08/22/2021 18:51

so the issue with lightable torches would be that every combo animation timer runs on the same cycle
so let's say you light up one torch
the next torch you light up would either extend the animation of the first torch, should the combo be set to restart animation upon being cycled to
or it would extinguish when the first torch extinguishes, if the combo is NOT set to do that
you'd have to make each unlit and lit torch a separate combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2021 18:53

^not necessarily

It would be neat to have an eweapon bomb that behaved like Link's bomb, sitting in place and then exploding after a few moments. This is basically the Sluggula bombs from A Link to the Past (in Misery Mire).

To add a speck of more customization to the Weapon Tab on the Item Editor.
Maybe have it to where triggering properties and enemy defenses are separate.
For example, being able to get the properties of the sword without applying its enemy defense.
Maybe as an item/rule flag that says "Lweapons On Items Don't Affect Defenses".

Okay so as for the Z3 tileset, let's compare how the palette changes outside Link's house and inside his house in the original game
Outside

Inside

That appears to be six tile CSets that change per-area, and about one CSet's worth of sprite CSets that change (though given that they seem to be for "things that look like tiles that are actually sprites", such as lifted pots, rocks, and bushes, they might be able to be conflated into 6 per-level CSets. Still, at least 6 per area)
P-Marx7 ‚Äî 08/15/2021
@Timelord you want a z3 tileset here's something for you to do
the secrets->nextcombo flag that emily added without your permission and the triggers secrets combo trigger attribute dimi added without your permission is also doing wonders for that tileset too by the way
now i can just make a 2x2 rock alias, set it to be bomb-triggerable, and have the ->next combos be the staircase, so the zquest user can place all that in one click without needing to place flags or set the screen's secret combos
that's why i made #lttp-rips and have been updating it the past few days
even set up a goriya enemy's big enemy tiles and screenshotted the correct enemy size parameters if you want a preview of what the tileset will be like once the more csets thing is sorted out```

....that sounds STUPIDLY simple. Question: How sensitive do you think it should be?

=== @ Mitsukara 08/28/2021 02:19

Hmm. I think a good range is about 4 pixels onto the flag, but some people might want more, or less, hard to say without fiddling with it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/28/2021 02:21

4 pixels is the standard for standing on a platform in sideview, so makes sense
and I think it's also the amount for the little side-push thing

=== @ Mitsukara 08/28/2021 02:34

In official Zelda games, Link's sword charge is maintained when he scrolls to another screen. In ZC, the sword charge stops and he has to attack and start over on the next screen.
If fixed, it might be good to have some kind of backwards compatability/QR/item flag/etc for the old behavior, in case someone wanted that for some reason. (Although it kinda sucks and makes the charge way less useful)
Not sure if having slash enabled would be relevant when fixing this either, because I know you have a slightly different spin attack when you don't know slash (it moves 4 ways instead of 8, which is really cool)

=== @ P-Tux7 08/28/2021 02:36

yeah this is slightly bs when the spin attack or hurricane spin cost magic to use

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/28/2021 02:38

there has to be a qr, of course
otherwise old quests would be broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 09:48

The problem here is probably that the sword sprite dies during the scrolling
....that might require some interesting workarounds.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/07/2022 10:11

i presume it would check the charge timer like how nayru's love regenerates itself and checks the time left after scrolling
if the sword charge timer and state aren't global like the nayru's love time left timer is... eep
i guess that would need to be changed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 10:13

My thing is, I don't immediately see why it would be being cleared in the first place, aside from the sword weapon being killed during scrolling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 10:16

ah no, a couple clocks are cleared in `resetflags()`
the weapon would still be a problem though I think

=== @ Guinevere 08/28/2021 04:19

Okay. so...I have no idea what's causing this, the areas where it happens are inconsistent between quests, but are consistent in where they happen. At first I thought it was a gollab bug since the screen scrolling was tied to a scripted warp pad so i just thought that it was just not applicable to 2.55.
But apparently some quests if the screen scrolls in specific areas, ZC crashes. They don't even need to be scripted quests.
And I know that it's not just a backwards compatibility bug because it also happens in my project as well.

when fixed screen scrolling is enabled;
if there are solid combos at one edge of the screen,  and nothing on the opposite edge, it blocks link from scrolling that way where the solid combos would be like if they were on the next screen in the same position.

idk why but sometimes it takes a couple times to scroll, but other times it only takes one attempt to crash

does it consistently do it on a specific transition?
if so, could you send a copy of the quest where you spawn in the room in question?

(but, need to do that in a debug build, attached to the dev chain, so gotta do it myself

A warp combo that acts as a scrolling warp when you step on it, but with a defined direction. Specific use case would be doors that are away from the screen edges
Having worked with a script that does this (very jankily), I can say that this transforms how you handle dungeon design in more GB-oriented sets for the better

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/28/2021 23:53

Of course, for it to be fully feature complete, it'd need to put you on a return combo on the other side

so, a fancy version of a scrolling warp

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/28/2021 23:57

yup
Scrolling warp has a problem in that it doesn't force your direction
so you could walk into a left door facing up, and you'll scroll the screen in the up direction

=== @ P-Tux7 08/29/2021 00:29

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 08/29/2021 00:50

Maybe it could be two combos:

1)  Side Warp Trigger - With selectors for North/East/South/West, and Screen and Dmap coordinates, as well as a numerical identifier that would be paired with the combo below.

2)  Side Warp Arrival - Mostly just acts are a receiver for the above.  Its one property is the numerical identifier.

The numerical identifier acts as a warp coordinate receiver.  So a side warp trigger combo with ID 3 would send it to a Side Warp Arrival ID 3 on that screen.

Not sure how it would handle going between two such combos though in the case of a door that goes between two combos, like most traditional north/south doors.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 08/29/2021 01:17

---
Or would it just make more sense to keep the X or Y positioning (and Z, probably.) and just go to the next available side-warp arrival combo in that direction you're already traveling in from the first screen.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/29/2021 01:54

Show-off. üòõ   But nah, it might be a combo that triggers the screen-scroll effect earlier, closer to the middle of the screen than being right on the very edge, and can probably even dump you somewhere not on the edge of the next screen too.

1. ignore health modifier if flipper level is (x) or above
this is basically where if you give the player level 1 flippers, they can still swim but the counter drain is in play. getting the right level of flippers removes it. also, maybe a setting of 0 (or -1?) means that no flippers will stop the effect
2. (rule) disable liquid drain while holding up an item
3. i'm unsure about how to implement this elegantly, but perhaps a drain rate for the liquid that can be divided, instead of it being a binary on or off?
what can liquids even drain right now? is it only health or is it all the counters?

Changing the bomb's weapon type affects both the bomb and it's blast

Emily told me to

=== @ P-Tux7 08/30/2021 07:45

the problem that i see is the lit bomb being able to trigger defenses but that's not what you wrote

=== @ Guinevere 08/30/2021 07:46

i mean i'm sure it gets the point across, i don't think the bomb itself should have a hitbox once a weapon type is added on to the item
seems a lil silly
<:teehee:620404816769843200>

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/30/2021 07:47

the weapon type effect should not apply to the bomb
it should still behave as a bomb

=== @ Guinevere 08/30/2021 07:48

and if the lit bomb comes into contact with an enemy, it kills the item and hurts the enemy like a normal lweapon

## ZQuest 2.55 tanking in FPS even more than 2.53 did. (#842)

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:08

So when I used 2.53, there would be this issue where the program would run at 30 FPS consistently, but when I would run a background process (A Discord VC, OBS, Steam, etc.) it would actually go _up_ to 60 for some reason. It's even worse here though, where the FPS is now locked at roughly 20 FPS when I'm not in other calls, but will not only move up to 45-50 FPS with a background process. While I have no clue what's causing the program to run better, it doesn't change that for some reason, there's a massive dip in FPS for 2.55 over 2.53.

I don't know if this is a feature already since I haven't kept up with development, but I got the idea so I figured I should post it:

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/02/2021 01:50

My first idea is some kind of ability to rearrange Dmap numbers, if you create your Overworld on map 4 for example, this ability would let you toggle Map 4 back to being map 1 again, without deleting and re-pasting maps in order to achieve this. All exits and stairs created won't becomes mixed up or erased while doing this.  Notice:  >   If this is not possible, i would like the ability to rearrange Dmaps without Exits and Stairs getting mixed up or messed up by trying to sort around my Dmaps by copying and re-pasting them. The idea would be a toggle option so transport destinations don't get ruined.

They're a custom scripted item (I _think_ in one of the Custom Item Classes?) that prevents the player from falling into hole combos (and gives them protection from stepping on spikes with a regular "boots" item).

well, or a VM, but we don't have that set up

hmm, I wonder if you can compile from within a flash drive boot of Linux, without needing to make a permanent installation

(the way Mint and most other versions of Linux work, you just format a USB flash drive to act as a boot device, and you can run Linux from that even without a permanent installation to a hard drive. I opted to install on my hard drive as well, but you don't have to do that to run Linux)

```-shield doesn't push urchin enemies``` Fixed

=== @ P-Tux7 01/29/2022 22:04

i dunno if you wanna detail it in the thread but i'd be interested to hear what the problem was in DM

=== @ P-Tux7 01/29/2022 22:07

Also, another quest worth looking into would be her 6th quest, since it uses much of the same ZScript functions. If it has bugs, fixing one there might fix it in Panoply. It can definitely clear your mind and make you realize a solution if you have two projects you can go back and forth between instead of focusing only on Panoply.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/29/2022 23:33

```-some sprite errors (sword beam break effect, ball and chain's chain)``` Fixed, Zoria was a dumbass and hardcoded default weapon sprites when the weapon creation code handled them based on item ownership and etc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 15:08

``//step = (type<2)?.5:0;`` Okay so see this
```-the candelabra only shoots two flames instead of three```
The thing that sets the default step for fire weapons is commented out
So script created fire weapons got changed to default to 0 step instead of 0.5 step, without regard for what this would break
thanks Zoria

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 15:35

I'm unsure if this is  abug or intended; autofire damage seems *really* low
lemme boot it up in 2,53

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 15:42

Okay, no, it seems intentional
I mean, they are level 1 stats

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 22:11

It's really annoying trying to debug issues introduced in early 2.53

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 19:26

```-guma's sometimes shoot straight projectiles with no set sprite instead of their "bolas"```
Fixed this; o_tile was for some reason changed to not be correctly initialized with script weapons, which would cause o_tile to either be the value of a previous weapon or random values, which tricked scripts into thinking that the weapon had been dealt with and made into a bola when in fact it hadn't

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 19:28

```-shield doesn't push urchin enemies```
```-bubbles after they finish their spawn animation stop moving/bouncing```
```-coppies copy the direction the player is facing but not the movements```
all of these are fixed, as they were the same underlying issue
and both```-the candelabra only shoots two flames instead of three```and ```-some sprite errors (sword beam break effect, ball and chain's chain)``` were fixed, as detailed above
granted, I have not yet checked the ball and chain

`Sort` will sort everything numerically
and when you sort, it takes a copy of the order it was in previously; and makes `unsort` pressable. `Unsort` will restore the previous order.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:43

It's purely visual, right? It won't fuck with the actual order?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:43

It does fuck with the actual order
there isn't a way to do it visuallyu
without completely rewriting how it works
but, `unsort` will put it back in the order it was in before you `sort`ed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:43

will it still save the order even if you go into a message string and then go out?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:43

yes, but not if you close the dialog

because that would persist even if you changed quests
bleh
yeah, so just be careful not to close the dialog if you intend to unsort

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:48

oh uhh
I see what's wrong
`PriceIndex` is `-1`
so it's reading `[-1]`, out of bounds
probably grabbing the price of the 3rd item

ahhhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:48

the entire `switch(tmpscr[tmp].room)` needs to be inside an `if(PriceIndex > -1)`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:49

```if (PriceIndex >= 0 && PriceIndex < 3) ```?

`>-1` should be sufficient
it will only ever be -1, 0, 1, 2

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "```-some sprite errors (sword‚Ä¶"): ...this reminds me of a more general weirdness I noticed a time or two, in 2.50.2, which I never checked if it's still in newer versions or how best to prevent it, but, sometimes when you created a LW_SCRIPT(number) weapon, it would, for one frame, have weapon sprite 1 (wooden sword) pointing north, before the graphic was set? Not sure if that's still a thing, or something I was doing wrong, it's been a long time since I poked at any of this
to the point where I'm not confident trying to post a bug report, but it might be an issue that existed, or exists

I mean... _maybe_ that made sense but it sounds kinda weird. I would think if I was nerfing it I would've gone for half-damage, or like, one level behind or something, like literally like, a flat level 1 damage no matter how much you levelled up.
Then again I defaulted to liking things tanky so I might not've even noticed and thought about it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/04/2022 01:03

(replying to @ Mitsukara "...I might've been incompeten‚Ä¶"): I was at level 1 at the time; it just seemed like Link was doing half the damage Zelda was doing as a partner

=== @ Mitsukara 02/04/2022 01:03

OH
okay, I think Link might have weaker swordbeams that match Zelda's arrows when he's a partner, yeah
I think that might've been part of the attempt to make Link suck less since there was a general consensus it was always better to play as Zelda
so that the actual sword does more damage when you're using it directly

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/04/2022 01:04

(replying to @ Mitsukara "I think that might've been pa‚Ä¶"): wow, you should have gone the opposite approach

## Allow moving item spawn position without selecting an item (#848)

=== @ Moosh 09/02/2021 10:18

This is the nittiest of nitpicks out there so keep in mind that I realize this. When you click the item square button in ZQuest it auto opens a prompt to select an item. Currently if you select (None) it treats this the same as having hit cancel. And in most cases this makes sense, if you're placing an item you probably want to place an actual item. But there is one exception to this: item cellar screen 80. In that one case, the item spawn position is used for an item set on another screen and no item will normally appear there. Whenever I set up a new screen 80, I'll just place a random item and then go back and set the screen item to (None), but since the cancel button is already a thing it'd be nice to cut out that extra step. Thoughts?

=== @ Moosh 09/02/2021 10:20

I also realize that there's no harm in leaving an item on screen 80. It'll get properly replaced. But it looks better in the editor without. Also the contents of screen 80 can still show up in quest reports, which may or may not be a bug itself

=== @ P-Tux7 09/02/2021 15:37

i'd call items an issue for quest reports, but the screen (or staircase and cave screens) can't be excluded entirely due to it having valid user-placed combos and enemies

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 04:27

this makes sense, though I could see it being annoying for some; can probably make it a ZQ config

=== @ Moosh 09/04/2021 07:07

Sounds good. Either that or a screen 80 specific exception

I'd like them to have seperate flags for letting them only/either affect the sword, hammer, or wand.

=== @ Guinevere 09/03/2021 04:49

(Tbh I want a flag where it only affects the sword but i felt that having one for all 3 would be courteous to others who'd like to choose exactly what it affects.)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 04:26

this makes sense, will just take a bit of fiddling to make sure the flags are checked by default in qst.cpp

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 04:30

having rings that affect the power of any lweapon and you could mix and match different rings and their flags for easier power upgrades/ring systems in quests instead of wasting tons of item space on a million upgrades to the items would also be neat, but i think that'll be a lil too much
so keeping it simple to just these are a good start.

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 17:25

I'm having a bug with the enemy editor. I went in to edit stats for enemies, saved the stats. Then when I went back into the enemy editor it had set its turn freq., halt rate, step speed and homing factor to 32767.

I tried this with enemies that had no scripts on them on a screen that also had no scripts on it.

I've edited ghost's shadows a little bit, but haven't touched anything else.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 18:19

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 18:31

Btw, this could be important. The only script I've added since then is the updated version of Newbie Boss. I don't think it would cause the problem though.
I had the old version and updated to the newest one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 18:32

a script literally could not cause a ZQ issue

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 18:33

That said, I've only edited a couple constants in ghost and Newbie Boss, which I can't imagine should have any effect, especially on normal enemies with no scripts on them.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 18:33

scripts don't run in ZQ
and the code to run scripts isn't even in `zquest.exe`

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 18:34

I didn't think it would. But I figured I'd at least mention the only change I've made since starting.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 22:06

...so, I edited an enemy, and instantly hit `OK`
Step speed became 1000
so I edited again, and hit `OK`
step speed became 32767, which is `MAX_SHORT`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/03/2021 23:07

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 23:18

It wasn't like this 2 or 3 nightlys ago.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 23:20

Nothing about the code directly surrounding it has been changed

aye, should have it fixed tonight or tomorrow, hopefully
this can't be that outlandish, building it in debugger mode should lead me quickly to the issue

Okay. Thankfully there's an easy path like that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 01:21

So, I changed how `vbound` was set up internally
and it uh
was acting REALLY fucking weird
and not doing what it should have been at all
so, I re-worked it *again*
and now it is working again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 02:08

so it was working again until I tried to build it in release instead of debug
and I fucking hate C++ once again

ok, got it fixed for real
fucking pain
will put out another build once I do a couple other things

i'd appreciate a method where you can disable f6 but also keep death continuing

oh, also, uh
forgot the simpler way
which is `Input->DisableKeys[]`

Input->DisableKeys[KEY_F6] = b;```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2021 23:18

You can't just bump font size, so you need to actually change the font to one that is larger
but uh
the external parser is gonna entirely change how compile errors work
...namely, they will be printed to external file, because the parser won't be part of the zquest process.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2021 00:30

. . . so now my question is
how does loading external text files for display work
like, how the `Help` button in strings displays `zstrings.txt`
and how the buffer editing works
.....and would there be a way to call that with variable font, to allow different sizes.

Ability to switch subscreen types using an Ex button 4 in game.  You could make at least 3 different subscreens that can be used for different things optional for your game, kinda like how Ocarina of time has 3 or 4 different subcreens to switch through, only you could do this in ZC. This would Allow room to put more optional stuff in the game, such as Maps and more items etc.

=== @ Guinevere 09/08/2021 02:04

these enemy types are pretty infuriating for the player to deal with, so if it's possible i'd like the data of the enemy affect it in some way
examples being where the random rate can maybe affect it's fall path of going left and right, and 0 would maybe make it only fall one direction and have step speed affect how fast it falls down

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2021 02:09

a more elegant solution for your quest might be to add an npc script to be like oot
where if link has a L2 shield or better, and he's facing the rock, it kills itself and produces an effect (probably a LW_SPARKLE made to look like a shattering rock, i don't know if rocks have a normal death effect)

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2021 02:12

i like your idea but there IS one issue with it that would prevent it from being executed well
i don't know if rocks respect enemy placement flags 0-9
so a right-down moving rock might spawn on the right-top of the screen. not very effective

=== @ Guinevere 09/08/2021 02:13

well that could also be added maybe
i got no idea how to do npc scripts
and besides i think it would be beneficial for everyone to have a simpler way to make them less frustrating to deal with that everyone has access to
and i feel that what i've suggested doesn't take away the spirit of how the enemy acts
<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2021 02:15

i'm pretty sure you just add a script and you can assign it to the enemy (which also means the script can reference its parent enemy or tell it what to do)

A way to when you call a music track by script for playback, it will take priority. Meaning that it won't go back to the regular DMap track as soon as you switch screen.

Differenty priority levels on the calls would be nice:
Retain while on the same DMap or canceled by script.
Retain Globally no matter the DMap till canceled by script.
-
where did the message go?
ugh
anyway, guess I'll re type it

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/08/2021 14:01

Priority playback as an option when calling music playback via scripts. So that a track can be maintained and don't switch back to the DMap track as soon as you screen transition.

More than one priorty level would be nice too if you could set it when doing the call:
Retaining while on the same DMap till either you switch DMap or a scripts calls for the priority to be canceled (or new track to be played)

Retaining globally till a script calls for cancel or a script calls a new track.

=== @ mitchfork 09/08/2021 14:11

This would be nice. The current only way to do this is to update the dmapdata music track as well, which you then have to manually "clean up" later - often in a different script scope than you started with

ZScript needs a dedicated, well-defined RNG, maybe something from boost::random. Because its Rand() and SRand() just call the corresponding C functions, the behavior varies by platform and is affected by ZC's own use of rand().

I knew something seemed off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:50

What should be done here is, add an `rng` class; maybe `randgenerator`
(to zscript)
and allow creation of multiple generators
each with their own state
and `randgenerator->Rand()`, `randgenerator->SRand()`
using some more deterministic rng on the backend as suggested

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2021 01:18

@ Saffith Mind testing for cross-platform consistency in the branch `2.55-newrand`?
if it's all good there, I can work on further zscript options, but that should cover the main engine rng being consistent.
(no need for `boost::`, since there's `<random>` in C++11+)

=== @ Saffith 09/22/2021 01:34

Ah, right, forgot about that. Yeah, might take me a day or two, but I'll try it out.

I fail to decrypt quest files. If I spam a key to make it keep retrying sometimes it suddenly decides to succeed once...

Build `2.55-randgen`, and run that quest in the built `zelda.exe`. It should print to console whether the RNG is consistent or not.

Didn't work, I'm afraid...
Damned if I can explain it, but apparently the only consistent function is `LRand` with no arguments.

(Also, ZScript_Additions.txt says LoadRNG is in FileSystem)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:29

Ah crap
`LRand()` is a straight call of the RNG with no filter
I think
While the rest use ` uniform_int_distribution`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:33

Yeah, that seems right
So something is off with that

=== @ Saffith 09/25/2021 03:46

I'm not sure that's meant to be deterministic. It sounds like the `mt19937` is just used to seed it. I think you just need to call `(*rng)()` and adjust the result.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:48

    if(lower > upper)
    {
        int t = lower;
        lower = upper;
        upper = t;
    }
    // std::uniform_int_distribution<int> dist(lower,upper);
    // return dist(*rng);
    return signed(unsigned(zc_rand(rng))%unsigned((upper-lower)+1))+lower;

## Rule to change NES boss HP distribution? (#867)

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:31

Some NES bosses that have multiple NPC components (Patra, Gleeok, Moldorm, Lanmola) appear to have some weird additional HP distribution mechanics that both make setting their HP in the enemy editor unintuitive and can make reading it with scripts awkward. You can see examples of enemies juggling HP values around when used in combination with my Link & Enemy Damage And Healing Numbers script

https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=364

So basically what I'd propose here is a rule that makes it so the values entering in the enemy editor are consistently treated as the HP values _per hitbox_. A Patra with an HP of 1 would have each eye die in one hit, a Gleeok would have the same HP per head and take damage linearly (instead of having heads break in weird patterns of hits like 5-3-3-3). And the segmented enemies wouldn't do whatever awkward jank they are doing.

Of course I know anything involving enemies is godawful. If this HP distribution stuff isn't something that can be reasonably modified feel free to reject in full or in part.

It might be possible I made a stupid on that one. Would have to test. The way I remember it, setting HP on both resulted in the enemy not reflecting the values I set

I remember a long time ago testing if you could set Link->Jump while LA_SWIMMING was happening, and it worked pretty well as far as I could tell. So it'd be neat to have an option on Roc's Feathers where you could jump while you're in water. 

(Ideally this would be a distinct option from sideview swimming; in LA I think you could jump out of the sideview water, but not the overhead.)

I guess the controls are a tricky issue. Maybe the feather could just override the dive command if it's on the same button?
once you _have_ jumped out of the water, you can use other items in midair until you fall in, and I think that worked okay when I tried it

So NightmareJames just ran into this one in Level 6 of ZNR, in the boss key room, during a stream. Went downstairs to collect a boss key, without killing all of the CSet 9 Keese in the room.
This was a brown dungeon with many dark rooms in an NES-tileset quest, so these Keese were colored black to blend in with the darkness in the room. Upon exiting the item cellar, the Keese in the (upstairs) dungeon room had picked up the CSet 9 from the item cellar's level palette, which was cyan like the Level 1 palette in the classic tileset, making the Keese no longer blend in with the darkness.

It'd be hacky but better than nothing
Maybe a QR that enables an Init Data field which lets you set which of the argument #s determines the layer of the FFC
Or just a QR hardcoding it to the last argument

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:11

In the enemy editor, there's a field for "Touch Effects" on the Walking Enemy type. Options include "Drain Rupees" (although a negative number will actually increase the rupees), as well as "Drain Life" and "Drain Magic". Can this be easily expanded to do things like Drain/Increase CR_SCRIPT1, etc?

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:13

Might warrant a separate request, but, it would also be neat if there was a "stun Link" option which just prevented Link movement (like NoAction()) for a certain amount of time, but ideally in a way where Link won't get stunned before he can move again. However, something like that could also be left to scripting.

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:15

Neither of these are high priority, but if it's easy to add it'd be neat.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 02:20

`Link->Defense[]` has a stun option
although I think that's only partially implemented (i.e. script only) at the moment? ( @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) any info on that? )
more touch drain options would make total sense

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/15/2021 02:30

Link->Defense is implemented in the UI
jman did that
It's under Quest->Player

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 02:33

Ah nice
That's the answer for the stun part, @ Mitsukara

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:35

Cool
Pushing my luck on this general subject... does it sound complicated to make these touch effects be applicable to weapons?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 02:37

Weapons should frankly be easy... but enemy/item attributes to set the weapons is a chunk more work.
(Neither out of the question; though I'd make a separate thread for that)

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 03:26

Couldn't one just have two checkboxes for the drain effect to apply to enemy touch, enemy weapon, both, or none?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 03:29

Firstly, that still needs adding vars. Checkboxes or dropdowns, still adding stuff. 
Secondly, then the next feature request that comes in is "hey I want to be able to have the touch drain X and the weapon drain Y"

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 03:35

I don't particularly care if it can just be scripted anyways (similar to curse effects on non-walking enemies and eweapons)

=== @ Alucard648 09/15/2021 17:59

What about  also add siilar expansion to eating enemies - Eat(Ccounter XX)?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 18:27

hmm can script reads of link's eaten status read WHICH enemy id he is being eaten by?

=== @ Alucard648 09/15/2021 22:12

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "hmm can script reads of link'‚Ä¶"): ```//Returns pointer to NPC that has eaten hero. Otherwise returns invalid pointer.
npc EatenBy(){
    if (Hero->Eaten) return;
    for (int i=1; i< Screen->NumNPCs();i++){
        npc n = Screen->LoadNPC(i);
        if ((n->X == Hero->X)&&(n->Y == Hero->Y)) return n;
    }
    return;
}```

As of 2.55 latest alpha.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 22:15

is there not a `HasLink` or somesuch readable on enemies?
(There *is* internally, so, would not be difficult to add if it's missing)

=== @ Alucard648 09/15/2021 22:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "is there not a `HasLink` or s‚Ä¶"): No such thing, as of latest alpha.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 22:23

1. Add more counters to touch effect drain
2. Add `bool npc->HasLink;`, read-only, to zscript
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
(your method might fail if multiple enemies are at the exact same x/y, this new addition would prevent that)

Status: fixed

Labels: ['bug']

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 07:23

ZC has some sort of limitation that makes it so a second fairly will not spawn* if there is a second fairy onscreen, even with a 100% item drop rate for just a fairy (moving; haven't tried stationary). 

 (* - _Usually, inconsistently_. Sometimes I could only get one to spawn, sometimes a second one would appear, but definitely not more than 2).

This may be a deliberate bit of code to try to simulate some sort of NES limitation (though it's not even accurate at that because you can have at least two fairies in Zelda 1), but it doesn't make sense / might warrant some kind of QR change or something. 

~~(Why do I have a feeling this is one of those "a previous dev had a hard-on for difficulty" bits of code, like the thing about not letting people use that one cheats program....)~~

However, spawning at least 3 fairies with FFC scripts works normally as expected, thankfully. So this is just something about how they work as item drops.

Was discussed here (found by P-Tux): https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/887461043117391872/887550177739694102

Note: This isn't a new bug, and I haven't confirmed it still works this way in 2.55 (though I would think P-Tux would know if it didn't?). Only tested it in 2.50.2 linux myself.

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 07:53

i think zelda 1 has a 1 fairy limit - if a fairy is on-screen, no enemies will drop fairies until that one is gone
and the other fairies spawning are when two fairy-spawning enemies are killed on the same frame, meaning that both checks for a fairy on-screen fail
it takes some careful practice or luck to perform, which is probably why phantom menace thought that 1 fairy was the limit

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 19:00

I suppose it makes some sense but it'd be nice to have the option to disable it for modern quests, at least.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 19:07

probably something to do with the fact that fairies are both an enemy and an item

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 17:04

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíFairy spawn limitations
@ Mitsukara the real reason this was implemented the way it was was because the item just grabbed the first fairy enemy on screen to attach itself to it

I understand they're Guys but enemy Goriyas and Guy Goriyas are different
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "because moving"): I'd have thought they would be an LWeapon in that case

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 19:59

guy fairies and item fairies are differnet too
lweapons don't have movement behaviors other than straight line

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:00

boomerangs?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 20:00

that's straight line, and when it dies, straight line
to add proper movement behaviors and the variables to store that it'd need to be a subclass of weapon
which would be annoying
as all `lweapon`/`eweapon` are a single class, no subclasses

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:01

okay so what did dimi turn the fairies into now?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 20:01

nothing changed
it's just that it no longer just grabs the first fairy enemy on screen for every fairy
it actually makes separate ones for each

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:09

well that's going in the lttp tileset
always-spawn-fairy combos like in the eastern palace pots

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:45

wait how'd you do it if more than one fairy couldn't exist

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:48

literally had to rewrite the system to give each fairy item a value that stores it's enemy counterpart

no i meant in HF

but the code seemed to suggest that it wouldn't

it's possible the limitation is just poor understanding on my part
but uh, the math used for tying fairies to enemies was fuckin weird

=== @ P-Tux7 09/16/2021 15:36

Guys are already editable in the 2.55 alphas. This allows for you to, for example, change Ama to CSet 7 like in BS Zelda with no scripting or 8-bit mode. I would like to request this to be retained, and for them to be renamed to "Goriya (Guy)" etc. to reduce confusion.
Something else that might also be cool is to allow rooms to have the room's Guy selector read all "Guy" enemies from the enemy list, and allow you to select one, allowing for custom Guys.  I know a lot of people just use invisible Guys and make the graphics as tiles so the Guys don't disappear, but I know users like NightmareJames like to use real Guys and even use scripts to change the room's Guy graphic.

=== @ P-Tux7 09/16/2021 15:47

Or in worst-case scenario, just entering the ID # of the enemy to be the Guy. Though it's not idiot-proof

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:37

Yeah, but I wanted it to be able to return from the proc.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:37

you'd just do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:39

```cpp
int GUI_EVENT(DIALOG* d, int event)
{
    if(d->flags&D_NEW_GUI)
        return new_gui_event(d-1, event);
    return -1;
}```
then
```cpp
int ret = GUI_EVENT(d, whatever);
if(ret >= 0) return ret;
```
....meh, either way
not a big deal

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:40

I prioritized minimizing the code changes in the existing procs, basically.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:40

fair

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:40

Anyway, I'm not seeing a problem with the frames myself...
And it doesn't look like anything weird happened to the code.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:41

oh, is it a windows only issue, just like the sprite invisibility?
that sounds fucking fun

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:41

Yep, seems to be.
And it's pretty simple, so I have no clue what the problem could be.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:41

oh ffs
question
you changed some function pointer stuff to no longer use `(*func)(params)` but instead `func(params)`
I'm guessing that's a c++ change?
I'm guessing something to do with `==` on func pointers is different
which would break `large_dialog()`

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:42

No, that was to do with the new ListData.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:42

and likely cause something approximately like this
oh
hmmm

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888230580855136327/888240145453694996/unknown.png)
well it appears not to be broken in small mode
so my suspicion of `large_dialog` seems correct

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:07

hmm,no
they are *only* broken in the init data dlg
wtf
only in init data, and only in large mode....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:11

. . .
and ONLY in ZQ
the same fucking dialog launched via the cheats menu in ZC
fucking works fine
WHAT THE SHIT

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:13

. . .I just have no clue
This does not make sense
whatsoever
the code is shared between ZC and ZQ
and the large_dialog code is shared by multiple dialogs
only this dialog, only in ZQ, is affected
this should *not be possible*
.....I have a fucking jank way to fix it, which I'm gonna do
(just remove the frames)

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:15

Have you tried rebuilding from scratch to rule out some sort of build error?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:15

aye, multiple times
that's always the *first* thing I try

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:16

Welp, that's the only logical explanation I had.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:16

I would say cosmic rays
but uh
that would need to be occurring every single time
which uh, not likely
there is no logical explaination for this, it is the new boogie-man
...time to jank around it.
(Replacing the init data dialog with a new gui system thing at some point would be wonderful)
(though, needs a lot of stuff)

Well, good excuse to do it.

looks a bit odd with the frames missing
but, for now, it will do
that gui will be a mountain of a project to rewrite, considering it's >3k indexes
but, a lot of that is generated in a loop
for the LItem stuff
....could probably do that in some saner way

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 06:17

the quests that were using the sounds default of the previous default module have been changed with the sounds of the new module

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 12:38

Don't know if this is a bug,but deserves a mention.  Second

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 14:29

???????

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 19:09

Since the new module changes the default sound effects, quests that used the previous default sound effects are now using the new ones.

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 19:11

So in laments terms
Zelda 1 sounds got turned into Koten sounds

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 19:12

sfx should be stored in the quest file
this points to a serious underlying problem

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 20:15

Good thing we reported it then

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 20:15

indeed
people can sorta fix it by going back to the previous module but it's still pretty weird that the sfx aren't tied to the quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:22

The problem I see here is this may not be fully fixable, depending on the exact nature of the problem
because to fix it may *require* a quest be re-saved
unless it stores the appropriate sfx, and is just *ignoring* them for the module, which is possible; I haven't looked into it yet

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 20:24

Hey @EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) , can we get together in the server's voice chat for a minute?  General1?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:25

give me a few, just got done with a super difficult run of a game that I've been doing for *hours*

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 20:25

OK

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:43

. . .
so no one is gonna like this
but it's literally not fixable
the SFX for the ones from sfx.dat are literally not being saved in the qst file
so old quests literally don't have anything in them in those slots
meaning either we need to include the copyrighted sfx in the default package *forever*
or break sfx in old quests
both of which are "unacceptable" outcomes
catch-22 situation, nothing we can do
....I can fix this for quests that are *re-saved in a new build*
but can't do anything more

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 20:46

mmm
that is pretty problematic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:47

gonna have to discuss with devs on course of action here
because either we break old quests
or we postpone being copyright-free until the rewrite

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 20:53

i mean
i know my two-sense isn't the strongest in terms of development discussions like this
but i think it would be much less of a headache if you postpone until the rewrite, since one of the main focuses of 2.55 is backwards compatibility with all the quests that were made in the previous versions
it keeps priorities of what you want to do with both 2.55 and the rewrite intact

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 21:13

https://youtu.be/WGWweXnW__w This is the bug in action (including a custom SFX in action)

=== @ vlamart 09/17/2021 22:27

If I work on a sfx library, should I follow the "tracklisting" in the constants doc?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:28

what listing?
The `SFX_` constants?

=== @ vlamart 09/17/2021 22:29

Yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:29

probably
scripts may potentially expect them to be as-is
and most questmakers keep their sfx in the same order as default for ease of use

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:38

May just be a bug with the Koten file included, when I hit Authentic NES when making a new quest, the water is not solid as it should be.

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:41

Trying the same in 2.53 implies it may be an issue with the template dialog though. Also solidity preview in 2.53 shows a teal color for walkable water with the rule off, yet the latest nigtly has it unmarked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:43

Water has never been *made solid* by rulesets
it is made *non-solid* by the more modern rulesets
but nothing has *ever* made it solid

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:43

Sorry the correct wording is it is not _left_ solid by the template dialog ü§¶

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:43

oh
tis quite different

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:44

So either it was never solid to begin or the template code that makes it walkable runs every time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:44

would guess never solid to begin with
because that code only exists in the blocks for the newer rulesets
and all instances of that code would pop up asking you for confirmation of converting the water
so if you get no pop-up asking `"Convert all water to non-solid?"` then it isn't doing anything

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:45

No pop-up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:45

then aye, it just isn't solid in that tileset

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:45

But hitting no on the popup still leaves it walkable
Odd that it's that way in both the 2.55 and 2.53 defaults

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:46

Fun thing is it never used to have a popup even though it always has done that conversion, as far back as 2.50.2

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:46

Anyways, I'm meaning to comb over all ZQuest dialogues I can and report any oddities I find

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:48

Regardless, any issues with that tileset won't matter long

Finished looking over ZQuest, only a couple things in the GUIs stood out as out of place:
```-Pickup flags in the item editor still has that big honkin' checkbox next to it
-SFX menu flickers when pressing the play button sometimes
-Background bezel on the side warp menu is mis-sized```
Here's what side warp triggers look like now

=== @ Moosh 09/18/2021 01:19

here's a snap of the play button flicker in action. Harmless but a little off. I'm really reaching to find anything in the editor that's immediately obviously broken, which is good

That's not a textbox. It's just a frame with text inside.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 03:28

huh
that makes sense then
but I know I opened some places that use frame and didn't see it

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:30

Are you sure it was in ZQuest? ZC seems to be unaffected.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 03:33

I could swear at least 2 spots in zq had no issue
but could have just been non-noticable
so, it's only in ZQ, and only in large mode
that points to `zq_custom.cpp` `large_dialog()`

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:36

Hm... The secret combos dialog looks weirdly okay.
Nothing's off by even a pixel.
`large_dialog(secret_dlg,1.75);`

// Identical to jwin_frame_proc, but is treated differently by large_dialog()

It could be something to do with the massive memory allocation/deallocation being slower for some reason
keep in mind that it generates and destroys 32 lweapons per frame
which all have a *full script stack* attached
.....should probably make it so the script stack only allocates the memory if it is going to be used.
.........for all sprite types......
which sounds like a fun adventure
might not be the only issue, though; could be something else at play

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "keep in mind that it generate‚Ä¶"): that's a funny way to do it

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:20

i thought it just moves the the lweapons just moved away from link until they hit the radius
<:derp:675738486397206578>

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:22

until i saw how slow it ran and you could see them replace themselves in slow motion

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:22

Nope, it generates new ones each frame; that's why they appear to not die on hitting enemies

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:22

i see
that's one way to do it
if that's the case how do things like piercing arrows and beams work?
do they work the same way?
or candle flames for that matter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:27

Those won't pierce an enemy with "Block" defense
Din's, pretty sure would
Given moving the flames and having a hardcoded pierce anything value would be far more sane
But ZC jankify

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:30

ouch

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:32

2 things to definitely help this:
- compat QR for old behavior, make new behavior where it moves the flames instead of creating new ones; needs new pierce behavior
- Make memory for script info only be allocated when it is first needed, not on sprite creation. This way unscripted sprites don't need to alloc/dealloc those. A simple `sprite::allocscript()` function to allocate the memory if and only if the pointers are null, and deallocating appropriately in the destructor, would fix this. This should lower lag of all sprite types significantly, including fixing particle effects.
Those are both just general optimizations though
not sure if there's a specific issue with C++17 that should also be corrected here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:34

Adding a general weapon piercing property, which could be script-readwrite, would be useful for the former; `*weapon->Pierce`. Would be `int`, with `0 = no pierce`, `1 = standard pierce`, `2 = pierce even block defense enemies`; 2 being what dins effectively does now

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:36

Looks like it's spending the bulk of its time in `sprite::draw()`.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:36

Oh?
That seems fun
And not what either of my optimizations would target
Does it occur with the compat QR `Old (Faster) sprite draws` enabled?

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:39

Haven't checked that, but I'm betting it does...
Looks like it's mainly `dithercircfill`, called from `doDarkroomCircle`.
`ditherblit`, in particular.
And that's mainly `getpixel`.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:41

Oh fun
Darkroom functions don't have a check to only run in darkrooms
That'd do it
And fire weapons have light radius by default
That's my bad

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:42

oopsie doodle

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:43

<:patcat:677072862036885504>

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:44

Yeah, it's a bit late for all that.

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:48

In a quick test of just picking up Din's Fire and using it twice, `getpixel` accounted for ~35% of the program's total run time.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:49

That's used in the dithering functions

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:49

Yeah. If there's any way you can cut down on it..

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:50

Not really... unless you want to look at optimizing the `drawing.cpp` stuff while having the same visual effect
But, making it only run when it actually is in a dark room will help a lot

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 05:17

I see almost no framerate hit by doing this:
```cpp
#include <allegro/internal/aintern.h>
void ditherblit(BITMAP* dest, BITMAP* src, int color, byte dType, byte dArg, int xoffs, int yoffs)
{
    int wid = zc_min(dest->w, src->w);
    int hei = zc_min(dest->h, src->h);
    for(int ty = 0; ty < hei; ++ty)
    {
        uintptr_t addr = bmp_read_line(src, ty);
        for(int tx = 0; tx < wid; ++tx)
        {
            if(bmp_read8(addr+tx) && dithercheck(dType,dArg,tx+xoffs,ty+yoffs,wid,hei))
            {
                putpixel(dest, tx, ty, color);
            }
        }
        bmp_unwrite_line(src);
    }
}
```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 05:18

I don't recognize any of those functions
But if it works smoother, then yes please
Does it respect the clipping rect of the dest?
Wait that's all on the src
So duh the dest code didn't change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 14:33

K
\#3 - saff's fix- is implemented, and works beautifully
also simultaneously made it so none of that shit runs if the screen isn't dark
or new darkrooms aren't enabled

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 14:47

Using `->Explode(2)`, running it a bunch of times per frame, I can cause this:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888637215637385226/888798434772025424/unknown.png)
which, is a solid FREEZE on trying to scroll screens, due to massive memory dealloc
optimization 2 should target this type of lag directly, so time to test that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:07

...well, it doesn't do as much as expected for this particular usecase
and took far more work than expected
but it should in theory be working now
....particles really still need to become a separate class, and not `: public sprite`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:13

. . . wait wtf
So, on optimization `1.` .... I appear to be wrong?
It appears to only generated the flames once, not each frame
. . . I could have sworn I ran into an issue with it generating each frame before . . .

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:21

ooh better din's fire now?
better as in can be blocked and doesn't spawn every frame

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:22

1. Dark rooms no longer run their drawing code when you aren't in a dark room
2. Dithered drawing is now just faster fps-wise, thanks to Saff's code
3. Sprites no longer generate script data if they aren't using it
Apparently it didn't spawn every frame? And I'm very confused by this?
Or if it is, I don't see any possible way the code that spawns it could be doing that, so

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:22

something i'd appreciate is a way to spawn the ring of fire routine without the actual item

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:23

?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:23

i.e. for a book fire effect, or an enemy making a ring of fire
some way to spawn it with a radius argument

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:23

blehg
far too much work

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:23

no sorry i meant
SCRIPT ONLY

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:24

so a script being able to just spawn a ring of fire?
That's a ridiculously easy thing to do in zscript
```cpp
for(int flamecounter=((-1)*(flamemax/2))+1; flamecounter<=((flamemax/2)+1); flamecounter++)
{
    Lwpns.add(new weapon((zfix)LinkX(),(zfix)LinkY(),(zfix)LinkZ(),wFire,itemsbuf[magicitem].fam_type,itemsbuf[magicitem].power*game->get_hero_dmgmult(),
                         isSideViewGravity() ? (flamecounter<flamemax ? left : right) : 0, magicitem, Link.getUID(), false, 0, 0, 0, itemsbuf[magicitem].family));
    weapon *w = (weapon*)(Lwpns.spr(Lwpns.Count()-1));
    w->step=(itemsbuf[magicitem].misc2/100.0);
    w->angular=true;
    w->angle=(flamecounter*PI/(flamemax/2.0));
}
```
that's the internal code
converting it to ZScript should be relatively easy
the `Lwpns.add` is just a `CreateLWeapon` that sets a bunch of the variables
and the actual ring is done by the `->angular`/`->angle` calcs
so like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:28

```cpp
void spawnFireRing(int x, int y, int dmg, int stp, int numflames)
{
    for(int flamecounter=((-1)*(numflames/2))+1; flamecounter<=((numflames/2)+1); flamecounter++)
    {
        lweapon weap = Screen->CreateLWeapon(LW_FIRE);
        weap->X = x;
        weap->Y = y;
        weap->Damage = dmg;
        weap->Step = stp;
        weap->Angular = true;
        weap->Angle = ((flamecounter*PI)/(numflames/2));
    }
}```
there you go

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:28

thank you!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:28

that doesn't set some of the vars the internal one does, like the parent item
but you wouldn't want those
oh wait, let me make an ew version

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:29

```cpp
void spawnLWRing(int x, int y, int dmg, int stp, int numweaps, int type)
{
    for(int count=((-1)*(numweaps/2))+1; count<=((numweaps/2)+1); count++)
    {
        lweapon weap = Screen->CreateLWeapon(type);
        weap->X = x;
        weap->Y = y;
        weap->Damage = dmg;
        weap->Step = stp;
        weap->Angular = true;
        weap->Angle = ((count*PI)/(numweaps/2));
    }
}
void spawnEWRing(int x, int y, int dmg, int stp, int numweaps, int type)
{
    for(int count=((-1)*(numweaps/2))+1; count<=((numweaps/2)+1); count++)
    {
        eweapon weap = Screen->CreateEWeapon(type);
        weap->X = x;
        weap->Y = y;
        weap->Damage = dmg;
        weap->Step = stp;
        weap->Angular = true;
        weap->Angle = ((count*PI)/(numweaps/2));
    }
}```
woo there you go, LW and EW version, and I made it take any weapon type

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:30

how does the fire know when to stop moving

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:30

err, it doesn't
stop moving
or if it does, that's hardcoded to fire weapons

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:31

oh well that's fine
i'll test it out with fire and see if it does

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:32

~~time for me to mod it as an npc death effect~~

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:34

you could also add a `script`/`InitD` param
to assign a script and init values to each weapon
which could be used for stopping them moving after a certain time
or doing any number of other effects
as it's a ZScript function, the number of ways you could simply modify it is endless

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/18/2021 17:08

I would formally like to ask about adding more fonts to the string editor and I personally happen to have a huge collection of fonts from various games, including Castlevania 3 - Dracula's Curse, Chrono Trigger and a few others. Here's the DL File for my personal font collection: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VQ0wm05uV8EQVqXrzeklGwviaUHQUZSF/view?usp=sharing
@<role: Developer> Heads up!

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 17:09

reminder that all fonts must be reduced to one colour

aye, my apologies.

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/04/2021 22:48

@ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) I vaguely recall you showing off screenshots of a build that had more fonts and I'm pinging you because I still kinda want the actual Castlevania 3 font in ZC
Please reply to this thread when you can.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 00:20

oh yeah where's the allegro font tool
nvm i'm dumb

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:05

@ FireSeraphimIwasgoingto add a `userfonts.dat`with twenty slots into which anyone could make a file and use those fonts via a module

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:06

I suppose that once 
I install vc2019 I coud add that. It is not that difficult
(replying to @ FireSeraphim "mind if I paged <@!2424224362‚Ä¶"): I do not  mind,but even if I did it isn't my server so as  long as it is permitted do as you wish.

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/05/2021 07:07

aye

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:07

It's about one total day of work to add this feature.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:09

I may just bake it into fonts.dat as ten user fonts and be done

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:10

I do however think that a custom userfonts is best with a command to load it n ZScript so that you can hot swap fonts adhoc.
this would allow a lot of freedom but it needs a lot  of GUI shyte in ZQE to support it

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:14

as it is not up to me now I do not have say on if this is going to be included if I make it and I want assurance that it will, ere I waste time creating it
I short I will not even begin on such a task unless the concept is preapproved.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:14

The question I have is, how much would it add to embed a few custom fonts in the .qst?
like how SFX are loaded?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:15

how much what?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:15

would that add too much bloat to the quest file?
if not, I feel like that would be a far better system

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:15

Fonts are bitmap images
you'd store tem externally
but if you do tat tewn ZQ cannot preview te messages

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:16

Why couldn't they be stored internally though?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:16

hence why I thought that a ten font userfonts.dat was the best solution

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:16

just write the contents of the bitmap to the quest file, `pfwrite()`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:16

I suppose they could
but that has the same problem
https://www.allegro.cc/manual/4/api/fonts/load_font
if you have a better idea there is the documentaton

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:17

I mean, it can `write_bitmap()` to a tempfile and then load the tempfile
if the load_font requires it be a file

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:17

that only supports GRX
IDK if the fonted output would wor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:18

`or any bitmap format that can be loaded by load_bitmap()`
if you read the full sentence

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:18

and again, there is the string editor and te subscreen to cnsider

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:18

`a GRX format .fnt file, a 8x8 or 8x16 BIOS format .fnt file, a datafile or any bitmap format that can be loaded by load_bitmap().`
For string editor/subscreen, the user fonts would just be appended to the dropdown lists

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:18

Sure
I do not ind this
but it reuires team effort
not e alone sitting and doing it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:19

aye, certainly

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:19

and the complications of working with an eternal repo pus the new vs version mean it won't happen fast
coding this is not that hard
for the basic font loading
I'd do it in ZScript first
then you can add the other crud
incuding the file sel dialogue to add a font
it will need a somewhat complex dialogue including storing a font name and a pulldown for the slot (1 to 10)
and will further deprecate Tango to a point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:22

well, it'd be kinda like the `SFX` dialog

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:22

so that is a bonus

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:22

you select a slot to edit, then name it and load a file

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:22

sure
I just want a team effort to add that jank

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:22

should be fairly simple, though I'll want to build it in the new system, so won't just be pure copy+paste on the sfx one

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:23

Adding a major feature like this is not something I a wiling to do solo
I am more than happy to do the skeleton implementation at some point and let you do all of the GUI crud

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:25

I still need to do the basic ffscript stuff fr rgbdata and palette
so I need to reserve registers and ASM opcodes for my use
first
twenty to thirty
I don't want to resolve erge conflicts on an external repo and futz about

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:27

in general when anything artificially pads a task to increase the amount of required time I just say no.
so reserving these allows me to avoid merge conficts
and thus not waste time

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 15:24

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "would that add too much bloat‚Ä¶"): i can't imagine so
allegro fonts are 1-bit images
i'm sure one page of 8-bit tiles would take the same amount of room as 10 or even 20 allegro fonts

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 15:26

and it should add almost zero bloat if the user does not ADD any, just like sfx and 8-bit tiles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 15:27

aye, fair

The way that boomerang and hookshot grabbing items works in zc is not intuitive and is very limiting. It would make a lot of sense to just have a `Grab-able` flag for each item that determines if they can be grabbed by the boomerang and hookshot or something similar.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 19:22

@ Lincolnpepper
Test if this works (new `IP_` constant, `IP_ALWAYSGRAB`, or pickup flags tab of item editor)

This would make lock blocks capable of changing and being dependant on ScreenD values. I can see a variety of possible uses here.

=== @ bigjoe 09/20/2021 04:27

If I could give examples. You might use strings to initiate the thought of getting a key from a bucket which could later be used on a lock block on the screen. Or you could have gathering mini games of sorts.

=== @ bigjoe 09/20/2021 08:07

Is this a viable idea? other combos have made use of Screen->D so I can see some use for it. Its by no means absolutely necessary, but would arm the user with "tricks up their sleeve"

The `Counter` value is an attribyte
meaning, it has a range of `0-255`, and literally can't hold a negative

I wrote a very simple function for RPG  quests, that can check the selected character and exchange the active subscreen, depending on it.

So I just thought it would be nice, if there was a Quest Script Option, that allows to instantly update the active subscreen Application (on every frame) if writing to "DMapData->ActiveSubscreen".

This is from a discussion in the Z-Zone scripting discussion channel with @ Lejes
In `__AutoGhostParseName()` there is a for loop to go through the NPC name string - there is a `return 1;` line that will always execute before the for loop finishes
this messes up AutoGhost in 2.55

=== @ Alucard648 09/21/2021 22:10

In all Collision functions all hitboxes are extended 1 pixel rightwards and 1 pixel downwards. Here is the example from std_functions.zh.
```

// Returns true if there is a collision between Link's hitbox and the FFC's.
// This only checks hitboxes.
bool LinkCollision(ffc f) 
{
    int ax = Link->X + Link->HitXOffset;
    int ay = Link->Y + Link->HitYOffset;
    return RectCollision(f->X, f->Y, f->X+(f->TileWidth*16), f->Y+(f->TileHeight*16), ax, ay, ax+Link->HitWidth, ay+Link->HitHeight);
}```
Here Hero`s default hit box counts as 17 pixels long, not 16 and 9 pixels high, not 8. In case of 1x1 FFC, its hitbox treated by function as 17x17 pixels, not 16x16 as intended. And that imprecision is across all collision detection functions in std.zh

This just occurred to me and I think it would be great if this was an engine side feature but the default slash in Zeldaclassic is the GB Zelda 45 degree slash and it would be great as either a QR or sword exclusive item attribute to have 90 degree slashes ala ALTTP.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/24/2021 18:13

btw something you *can* do is port the variable length property of Z3 swords to the current sword

Adding hotbox sizing to base swords is far from trivial

Or z3slash
Or whatever I called it

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 18:22

Without the metrics and frame details, if fell to the bottom of my list. scripts allow implementation of it by anyone who wants to try and if they provide the script then  we could add I to future engine versions.

`10*4` are both number literals

That's a `const int`
a constant, not a variable

int arr[SIZE];```
that works fine

Or if you need all the space, just make it sized `MAX_INT`

=== @ OmegaX 09/25/2021 05:15

May I ask why ZC can't use variables to define array size? (being able to do something like would be really useful)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 05:28

because it uses the size during compile
it might be able to be changed, but it wouldn't work well with global arrays, which would be problematic and/or require additional error checking, which is a bunch of work to do.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:03

I'm running into a curious phenomenon where the last 4 frames of my custom animation for the MISC:Death sprite is simply not playing. I partly suspect it has something to do with how that animation is handled by default. I have the number of frames set to nine and the animation speed set to six. The animation speed variable doesn't seem affect MISC:Death.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:05

As a test, I recommend starting a fresh quest file and then importing and setting this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/598566141992108032/891132421884506122/16x16_IOG_Death_Animation.png as the MISC:Death animation (since that's what I was using) with the same numbers I was using.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:14

I went ahead and make a quick pair of gifs to illustrate what's actually happening in comparison to what should be happening

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:15

This is how it looks in game due to the bug in question

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:16

This is how it should look. The animation and spritework is meant to resemble the enemy death animation from Illusion of Gaia

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:45

@<role: Developer> Sorry to pester you guys, but I figure a bug like this wouldn't be too difficult to fix

=== @ P-Tux7 09/26/2021 01:43

while we're at it, can you check the poof spawn animation as well?
and the "blocked" effect (boomerang on edge of screen or shooting an arrow at a darknut)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 04:31

The `iwDeath` sprite only reads the tile, nothing else. So the frame count/speed is hard-coded.
to fix this without giving enemies custom death sprites per-enemy would be stupid... so this'll be fixed whenever the energy to add that is found

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 03:58

so
firstly

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892258891084234762/unknown.png)
this won't fix the frames, but lets you pick what sprite you want

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 04:10

Thank you. I take it that it will be tonight's nightly build?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 04:11

still working on fixing the frames part

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 04:11

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:09

@ FireSeraphim if you wouldn't mind testing this out

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:09

Honestly I'm not a coder by any means.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:09


https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892276911571599380/buildpack.zip
not necessarily the script part
There's a QR under `Backwards compat -> 3` for changing the hardcoded frames
and the enemy editor `Graphics->Sprites` tab for changing the sprites on enemies without scriptsw

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:11

I'll test the QR thing. I'm not interested in driving myself mad by trying to manually set each enemy's death sprite to a new one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:12

as long as it fixes the issue you reported

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:21

I'm testing it now. I'll let you how it pans out on that front

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:22

The ability to switch the sprite was the easy part, so frankly I don't expect issues with that at all
but the animation frames stuff is janky AF
thankfully if it works in once place it should work in all since it's the same code

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:23

It works on my end. Now I just need to tweak the death animation to not play so fast

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:23

woo
it played fast, that's a good sign
guessing the speed was 0?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:24

I had the speed on six for a nine frame animation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:24

ah, you had edited it
that's about half a second for the whole anim
...given, the engine one only ran for 18 frames
if I read this right anyway
I'll leave this open marked sick for a bit in case any issues come up with it

Not quite there yet...
Now I can't help but to wonder if I'm doing it wrong on my end.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:29

oh?
What's your setup

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:29

9 frames, speed of 12 (and the animation still seems to play too fast from what I'm seeing)
(replying to @ FireSeraphim "As a test, I recommend starti‚Ä¶"): These are the sprites I'm using

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:30

this is unchecked?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:30

Yep

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:33

Is a lower number the way to go for a slower animation? Just now tried it with the frame speed set to 16 as a brute force measure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:33

lower is faster
I noticed something wrong
one moment

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892283008122499072/zelda.exe
try that
(I thought the sprite anim clock was counting up.... turns out it was counting *down*, so something was set up backwards... oops)

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:39

Nope. Just now set the animation frame speed to eight and it's still playing too fast

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:39

Really?
oh wait
fuck
I'm stupid

...wtf
....not gonna get this done tonight.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:16

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) I did some further testing
It only seems to affect my quest
Link seems to appear just fine in other quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:18

...load an older backup of your quest?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:18

I am temporarily re-enabling the QR for backwards compatibility
just to see if it fixes that anomalous behavior
and then I'll load an older copy of my project afterwards as a futher test

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:23

loaded and tested the copy I sent you at 'round midnight and the same phantom elf problem persists

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:24

Did the QR fix it?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:24

Nope
I did some futher tentative experiementation and link and the enemy and item sprites are invisible. I can seemingly still move the invisible elf into new screens and all
the items aren't invisible in the subscreens.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:27

enemy shadows are still visible as well as other particle effects (have not tried giving myself a magic or fire boomerang yet)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:28

How about `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing`, under `backwards compat -> 2`

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:29

Trying that now.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:30

That seems to have fixed the invisible elf problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:31

that helps narrow it down

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:31

Now I am going to do yet another test and re-disable the new QR you added for death animation as a experiement

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:32

The funny thing is, the same new code runs regardless of the state of the old drawing QR
so a new issue shouldn't be caused by that
let me rebuild from clean

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:37


https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892298998487064637/buildpack.zip
@ FireSeraphim try this, either will fix everything or change nothing

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:38

Alright.
I'll let you know how it goes

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:43

It seems to play alright so far, other than the `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing` rule still being enabled. The new death animation QR is still disabled but I'm noticing an old thing where the death animation doesn't play all the way through on certain enemies (zols and bats) and the death animation is still too fast despite me setting it to a frames speed of 16.
I am going to disable the `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing` rule real quick and see how that pans out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:44

if the death compat qr is checked, the animations will be locked in speed and frames
also I just noticed another issue

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:44

that QR is currently not checked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:44

fun

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:45

disabled `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing` just now and the elf and friends are once again invisible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:52

ok, try this one now.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892302947810148392/buildpack.zip

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:06

Elf and friends are no longer invisible. You're making steps in the right direction, but custom death animations are still borked, in that it doesn't play all the way through and on some enemies it starts on a different frame (bats and gels come to mind as an example)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:07

send allegro.log

hmm, that only has zq logs
run it in zc again, make sure to watch a death animation
then send allegro.log

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:09

I just now enabled log game events and log script errors to allegro.log in my quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:09

shouldn't matter
I added debug logs
which don't care about the rules
should also show in the console if you have that open

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:11

I don't have that opened

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:11

it'll also show in allegro.log, so

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:15

I currently have the misc-death animation at a framespeed of 16 if that helps. I haven't changed that since last time

huh, not seeing anything in the log
Go to `ZC->Show ZScript Debugger`

Oh

Here's the log after the debugger been enabled
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892310056178167878/allegro.log
I suspect the text near the bottom would be of interest to you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:22

nope, nothing there useful
the debugger being on won't change allegro.log
it will let you see the information printouts as it happens
which should be whenever something is doing a death animation

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:24

I don't know what you're looking for. I'm killing enemies and getting stuff like DeathAnim: (3/16), fr (5/9)
the fr 2/9 is coming from me killing keese

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:25

It should be printing once per frame of the animation
so the first is saying `(3/16) speed`
and `frame (5/9)`
for a 9-frame 16-speed sprite

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:26

fr 0/9 from killing gels (the little slimes)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:26

it should be making multiple prints per enemy
Technically, if it were working right, it should print `9*16` times per enemy

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:26

it is, but the fr numbers is remaining the same per enemy killed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:27

that... isn't right

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:27

just not got multiple fr 2/9 from killing a keese once

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:28

you should get the same fr value 16 frames in a row

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:29

I don't know what to tell you because I don't know what you're looking for.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:29

hopefully for those values to appear in allegro.log
because everything in the console should appear in the log

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:31

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:50

the death animation seems to be working for the most part. There's just a minor curious hiccup where near the end of the animation it repeats the first frame, it's appropriately slow at a speed of 16 so I'm going to dial that back down to 8 and see how that looks

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:53

oh boy. dialed it down to eight and the zol (little gels) are still playing the animation really slow.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:54

ditto for the octorocks playing the death animation slow despite me dialing the animation speed back down to eight (the keese seem to respect the animation speed variable and plays it at the expected 8 speed)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:55

it should be all or nothing

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:56

peahats seem to respect the 8 anim. speed
black and red moblins play the animation slow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:58

they should play it the same if it's set to the same sprite

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:05

I checked. They are set to the same sprite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:07

see if this fixes anything

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:12

gels, octorock and moblins are still playing the animation slow. Other than that you have seemed to fix the hiccup I mentioned previously

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:14

in my test quest octoroks play it fine

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:15

What I just sent you my quest again via dm? I suspect that might be more productive

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:15

sure
With 9 frames 8 speed, that should be 72 frames, just over a second

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:22

@ FireSeraphim it seems to be working fine in your quest

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:23

Wha?
that's not what I'm seeing on my end

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:23

are you loading a fresh save file?
or one that was saved before?
....given, I don't think that should matter, but that's always the first thing I check

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:25

just now started and tested a fresh save file
still having the slow anim. from gels

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:25

Zoras and Octoroks appear to be animating properly
I frame-counted with frame-advance
the full anim is 72 frames long
which is a bit slow
but that's how you have it set up

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:27

have you killed a keese yet?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:27

oh
I just killed a tektite
so, uh
the slow animation is not the problem
that's correct
the fast one is the problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:31

oh
oh wait you motherfucker
. . . so, enemies that are in the air are drawn multiple times per frame. Which uh. Fuck.
Need to move where this logic is done

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:47

well at least it's two steps forward and one step back, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:56

so, the invisibility seems to like coming back constantly on me
but goes away when I build from clean
....fun annoyances that make it take much longer to compile, yay
<a:hugheart:884673091878391828>
hopefully this will be done soon

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 09:55

fucking hell
that was an hour solid of trying to get sprites to stop being invisible
I hate everything
I think I fixed everything

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "the death animation seems to‚Ä¶"): this is how all animations work iirc with the looping
so putting a duplicate frame at the end can pretty much fix the appearance of it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 16:22

I fixed that issue

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 18:17

Sorry about that guys, I was honesty up past what I should have been
I'm in the Central Time Zone and our discussion (for me at least) was past midnight.
I'll promptly let you know how it both pans out

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 18:40

I can confirm that the animation bug is fixed on my end. With one caveat: now the octorock, gels, keese and moblins are missing their death sound while the aquamentus and dodongos aren't.
Just one last little problem

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 19:17

=== @ P-Tux7 09/26/2021 01:44

oh yeah i noticed years ago and reported it on the old server. this applies to getting a ring and then BEATING a quest without saving as well
it may be tricky to write it to the save file without saving the rest of the game as well

=== @ P-Tux7 09/26/2021 01:46

Attempting to load DoR in the latest nightly is yielding some seriously strange results. Many combos have wonky CSet2 properties and cset offsets

According to Russ CSet2 was set to 1 in 2.53. Now it's 15
Clicking a combo and clicking OK also changes it to 11

see if you can figure out a good way to handle this, Dimi....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:23

....also, why would you `vbound` and then `%12`? the modulo is supposed to be doing the bounding there, so the logic is slightly off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:25

So, it seems that the issue is of sign
because the 0-16 value range
was treated as `-8 to 7`
....so, uh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:31

something like
```cpp
if(loading_old_version)
{
    int cs = temp_combo.csets&15;
    if(cs&8) //sign bit
    {
        cs |= ~int(0xF); //bitwise shit to make it correct
        temp_combo.csets = 12+cs;
    }
}```
...won't work perfectly, but will fix most situations
it won't fix it if csets 12-15 were being used
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 's change to fix, when she's up to it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:05

great job windows

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:52

Also I can add exclusions but only at an exact path. eg, a file named zelda.exe in my downloads folder but not any file named zelda.exe
That seems like an important distinction to be able to make

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:52

yep I hate that so much
guessing it doesn't like `*/zelda.exe` as a path, huh?

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:54

That would imply being able to specifiy a path as a string, rather than with a file picker dialogue ü§î

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:54

oof
probably a string somewhere in the registry.... totally safe to edit, right?

Maybe if I hack up some registry shit it'd work, but it's not worth that level of effort

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:55

Anyway, to the issue at hand
there's a compat QR, should be enabled when loading any quest saved before *this build*
with it on, cset2 will work exactly as before

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:56

probably sound like a boomer here but this just shows how infanitilized tech is becoming.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:56

also, independently fixed the issue with negative values

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:57

I recall I used to complain about odd issues with windows usability but at least back then they could trust the user to use their own shit
And yeah, DoR appears to load properly now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:57

now do `pick ruleset: modern`
and see if anything changes
(or disable the compat rule on the last tab)

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:58

Modern ruleset doesn't appear to have changed anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:59

k, so most of the issue was the separate bug
the QR affects the wrapping of csets, so if you have `CS 11, CS2 +1` that will go to `CS 12` in old quests, but `CS 0` in new quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 08:01

So something related to the gleeok taking damage I assume

To be clear, is this the kind of crash where Windows reports ZC is not responding, the kind of crash where the window closes immediately, or the kind where the screen stops updating

=== @ NightmareJames 09/26/2021 23:36

Yes

=== @ NightmareJames 09/27/2021 14:29

Reproduced the crash in another room, this time the Pols Voice room/Like Like room with Red and Blue Bubbles.  Has something to do with Red Bubble Jinxes I believe, which were also in the Gleeok room
I could recreate all three rooms in a test quest with all the current items if needed

Whenever you compile scripts in newer version of ZC it blarts loud audio. This is obviously an oversight, but it completely hurts the ears every time.

EWeapons and LWeapons are the only scripts that I've observed have the problem

There's some stupid variable naming
And a backend refactor of some code left something checking `script` instead of `weaponscript`
... nice thing is now sprites (npc/wpn/itmspr) don't allocate script info or stack memory unless they have a script
And they all use a consistent function for script running
.... but weapons have a tiny difference for no good reason, thanks zoria.

This would work similarly to CopyTile() and similar functions, but be sourced from a ZScript bitmap. I imagine arguments would look something like:
`BitmapToTile(bitmap b, int x, int y, int dest, bool eightbit)`
It'd always copy in 16x16 sections from the source bitmap and if 8-bit is turned off, would merge the colors into one cset by index like in the editor. Hopefully the internals of CopyTile could do enough heavy lifting that the latter part isn't especially difficult. If not I wouldn't be against assuming 8-bit in all cases. But yeah, this would be handy for paper doll systems, switching out large graphics banks from external files (would probably require a loading screen) and just generally give ZScript total access to the tile page.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2021 07:21

Tile stuff uses *pointer math*, so it's always a huge headache to comprehend what *anything* is doing
which is why this hasn't been done already
but, this is certainly something I'd like to add at some point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 06:48

uh
this was way too easy

All 17 of those tiles are blank at the start, and nothing ever changes what tiles are being displayed, nor is there any copytile usage.
Bitmap drawing to tiles magic
```cpp
void WriteTile( int layer, int x, int y, int tile, bool is8bit, bool mask);
 * Writes a 16x16 area from (x,y) of the bitmap at layer 'layer' 
 *     TO the tile page, overwriting the tile 'tile', either 4 or 8 bit.
 * If 'mask' is true, overlays instead of overwrites```

Splendid. And it's updating in real time too? Looks excellent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:10

Obviously it has the same restraints as CopyTile
in that it won't carry over between reloads and such

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:10

No copying to blank tiles I assume

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:10

?

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:10

Though IIRC, flagging a tile as 8-bit makes it no longer treated as blank

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:11

why would you not be able to write to blank tiles

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:12

Beats me. Been that way as long as I remember. I kinda figured it had something to do with how tiles are compressed. Though in hindsight it may just be a bug ü§£

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:12

is that an issue with CopyTile?

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:12

As far as I can tell yeah
Didn't try with the other variations
And haven't tried it yet in 2.55 to be fair

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:13

I see no reason that should be the case
either for copytile or for this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:16

..and uh, in fact, the tiles in the video were 'blank'
so

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/28/2021 01:51

Apologies if this has already been requested, but I was wanting to request enemy knockback as a feature.

The idea is that take a darknut for instance. Darknuts probably wouldn't realistically get knocked back by sword as like a keese.

Furthermore, with enemies drowning in water being a thing, enemy knockback could be used to make that harder.

Bonus points if you could alter the knockback the enemy experiences based on weapons.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 01:52

Scripts can access scripted knockback via new npc-> commands

=== @ P-Tux7 09/28/2021 16:02

the darknut thing isn't even scripted
you'd just set whatever npc flag determines knockback to 0 via npc script
as usual removing is easier than adding

## Higher level bracelets affecting block pushing speed as an item attribute (#915)

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/29/2021 02:41

Wouldn't be possible to have bracelets that have a noticeable effect on pushing speeds on lower tiered/leveled blocks. An example being a Lv2 Bracelet pushing a Lv0 Block at a noticeably faster speed. Partially quoting myself but I think this simple tweak might be a good idea.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 02:43

Wouldn't be level-based, would be an attribute of the bracelet item

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/29/2021 02:45

I see.

And also ability to push multiple blocks at the same time.
