Create a new thread to request a feature!

Or at the very least, have it so that combos such as lock blocks can work like regular locked doors in that they set the unlocked door status for the screen in the approprate dicretion.  It could be done through scripts, but it would be easier to add as a combo.

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 22:35

I am a little unclear what universal locked doors means

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 22:36

Are we talking about a lockblock combo you can place anywhere that just unlocks that one combo, permanently? That sounds useful but also maybe a bit tough to implement
## ✅🔒Bug Report String 65 Being Played In Mystical Harps (#798)

Bug Report: In Mystical Harps, the following three screens have a LOT in common, and they all throw a very big error. Picking up any item on them will cause string 65 to be played. They all have the same shop, same string, (possibly) same guy, and two of the same flags set Item Falls From Ceiling, and Hold Up Item.

yes, one of the items to which this situation responded did not have any scripts on it, even the janky ass old pickup timer scripts. I had both scripts cleared and this still happened. It happens on these screens. Something about all these screens triggers it, and I TraceS()ed every instance of Screen->Message in the global script

## Blackout Fade options for specific warps (#800)

=== @ Mitsukara 08/18/2021 03:54

Currently ZC supports multiple types of black opening wipe (also used by Entrance/Exit combos). These include rectangles from the sides (Z1), Circle, Oval (LTTP), spinning Triangle, and Super Mario All-Stars (tiles).

However, they're set up to work quest-wide with quest rules. It would be neat to be able to set each specific warp to use a specific type of fade. (also to be able to do it without relying on entrance/exit combo warps specifically would be nice, since those mess with continue points). Perhaps a fade in / fade out option on each warp combo somehow? Whatever works.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/18/2021 03:58

^sfx too

=== @ Mitsukara 08/18/2021 04:04

ooooh yes, a sfx that doesn't get interrupted by the warp would be awesome

=== @ Mitsukara 11/19/2021 09:03

Reviving this one to add some additional ideas.

- The "static"-y effect from the darkness dithering which clears the screen
- A black rectangle that covers the screen from left to right.

also I didn't clarify this before, but it would be really neat to be able to manually set a fade-in for arriving at a warp, so that you can have it fade out when you leave, then reliably fade in when you arrive (currently this only works on certain kinds of warps, I think maybe Entrance/Exit warps or caves?).

As for current ZC version, Clock item cannot stop time without rendering Link invincible at the same time, unlike Castlevania. Here is the link to ancient PureZC forum thread about my futile attempts to do proper time stopping item script.
https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=62768

=== @ P-Tux7 08/18/2021 06:13

while we're at it
can we make the clock attributes script-writable
link's invincibility and the time stopping (both with args for how much, 0 being "infinite until further notice")
so that if you want a "inventory clock" item you don't have to spawn a literal clock on top of link

=== @ Alucard648 08/18/2021 07:17

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "while we're at it"): 1. Already possible in 2.55 a92
2. I like idea of separate durations.
3. As for Stopwatch, it could keep as is (spawning clocks on top of Link). And add function to check if time id stopped or running.

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 02:52

It would be kind of a neat option. Link's sword also generates sparkles with charging / spinning in LTTP, but I'm not sure I should make a feature request for that, just thought I'd mention it here.

=== @ Dr00g 08/20/2021 20:31

i think the idea of Crystal Switches that affect a combo in a whole Dmap is kinda cool without the use of a bunch of Secret flags,  So like a combo is Crstal A and B and then Crystal block A, B C and D for diffrent colors raised and lowered

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 21:52

You could just have an animated combo for the sparkles
either have the switch combo itself have them, or have a switch block combo on a layer above the switch (switch block so it changes color of sparkle based on the switch state)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 21:54

the problem being, we don't know exactly what your switch combo will look like, so it wouldn't look the best without a number of ways to configure it... which then clutters up the combo options for one visual feature

=== @ bigjoe 08/20/2021 21:55

ive already solved it with a script, so you can mark this as "better off with a script" I guess. I was just thinking with future LTTP designers in mind

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 21:55

@ Mitsukara for the sword, that probably would be doable, just similarly to arrow sparkles, on a flag, using a weapon sprite from the sprite list. Make a separate thread for that?
(replying to @ bigjoe "ive already solved it with a…"): My point being you don't even need a script, just an animated combo

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 21:56

That depends on how far off to the sides of the switch the sparkles go, but yeah. Seems low priority in any case

In LTTP, Link's sword creatse sparkles (basically LW_SPARKLE) which move up the tip of Link's sword while charging / sit in front of the tip when charged, and then his spin attack also creates sparkles around the sword. 

Some approximation of this, creation LW_SPARKLES on the LW_SWORD during LA_CHARGING and LA_SPINNING, would be a neat option in-engine (though it's not that hard to do with scripts, so low priority).

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 22:00

^ More priority to this, because it resolves a major issue of 8-bit sword sprites not being able to display charge progress

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 22:01

In LTTP, Link's sword creates sparkles which move up the tip as he charges, then appear near the front of the tip when charged, and then continues to make sparkles around the sword during the spin attack.

Something similar could be achieved by creating LW_SPARKLEs on the LA_SWORD during LA_CHARGING and then during LA_SPINNING, which would be neat. (Although this can be mostly handled by scripts, scripts have no way of telling how far along the charge progress is so you can't really do the move-forward-on-the-blade effect). Alternatively you could wait for the sparkles to appear at all until charging is done.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 22:01

would use an item flag to enable, and a `Sprites[]` sprite for the sparkle

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 22:02

Ah, whatever works
it is worth noting the position of the sparkles shifts a bit. The ones on the tip seem to move from side to side a bit.

When you change DMap palettes via side-warp, the level CSets fade to black and fade back in on the next screen.  Requesting a QR to apply this to all CSets (except 6)
this prevents the following from happening with combos in sprite CSets:

=== @ Jennette ❣ 08/22/2021 12:32

This could have several behaviors that are seen in official Zelda games.

For starters:

Shooting through it with an arrow could give it fire properties

As well, if a torch combo is on screen it could make a screen count as "lighted" in the context of dark rooms. This could be helpful for a variety of reasons, such as if people don't want the candle itself to provide light, if they want temporary light from lit torches or if they want a screen where you have to light torches to permanently light it up.

also, it's a bad script

=== @ P-Tux7 08/22/2021 18:51

so the issue with lightable torches would be that every combo animation timer runs on the same cycle
so let's say you light up one torch
the next torch you light up would either extend the animation of the first torch, should the combo be set to restart animation upon being cycled to
or it would extinguish when the first torch extinguishes, if the combo is NOT set to do that
you'd have to make each unlit and lit torch a separate combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2021 18:53

^not necessarily
you could make a bunch of combos, each of which lasts for 1 frame before cycling to the next
then they'd effectively run on their own timers

neat also that's viscerally disgusting

It would be neat to have an eweapon bomb that behaved like Link's bomb, sitting in place and then exploding after a few moments. This is basically the Sluggula bombs from A Link to the Past (in Misery Mire).

To add a speck of more customization to the Weapon Tab on the Item Editor.
Maybe have it to where triggering properties and enemy defenses are separate.
For example, being able to get the properties of the sword without applying its enemy defense.
Maybe as an item/rule flag that says "Lweapons On Items Don't Affect Defenses".

P-Marx7 — 08/15/2021
Okay so as for the Z3 tileset, let's compare how the palette changes outside Link's house and inside his house in the original game
Outside

Inside

That appears to be six tile CSets that change per-area, and about one CSet's worth of sprite CSets that change (though given that they seem to be for "things that look like tiles that are actually sprites", such as lifted pots, rocks, and bushes, they might be able to be conflated into 6 per-level CSets. Still, at least 6 per area)
P-Marx7 — 08/15/2021
@Timelord you want a z3 tileset here's something for you to do
the secrets->nextcombo flag that emily added without your permission and the triggers secrets combo trigger attribute dimi added without your permission is also doing wonders for that tileset too by the way
now i can just make a 2x2 rock alias, set it to be bomb-triggerable, and have the ->next combos be the staircase, so the zquest user can place all that in one click without needing to place flags or set the screen's secret combos
that's why i made #lttp-rips and have been updating it the past few days
even set up a goriya enemy's big enemy tiles and screenshotted the correct enemy size parameters if you want a preview of what the tileset will be like once the more csets thing is sorted out```

4 pixels is the standard for standing on a platform in sideview, so makes sense
and I think it's also the amount for the little side-push thing

=== @ Mitsukara 08/28/2021 02:34

In official Zelda games, Link's sword charge is maintained when he scrolls to another screen. In ZC, the sword charge stops and he has to attack and start over on the next screen.
If fixed, it might be good to have some kind of backwards compatability/QR/item flag/etc for the old behavior, in case someone wanted that for some reason. (Although it kinda sucks and makes the charge way less useful)
Not sure if having slash enabled would be relevant when fixing this either, because I know you have a slightly different spin attack when you don't know slash (it moves 4 ways instead of 8, which is really cool)

=== @ P-Tux7 08/28/2021 02:36

yeah this is slightly bs when the spin attack or hurricane spin cost magic to use

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/28/2021 02:38

there has to be a qr, of course
otherwise old quests would be broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 09:48

The problem here is probably that the sword sprite dies during the scrolling
....that might require some interesting workarounds.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/07/2022 10:11

i presume it would check the charge timer like how nayru's love regenerates itself and checks the time left after scrolling
if the sword charge timer and state aren't global like the nayru's love time left timer is... eep
i guess that would need to be changed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 10:13

My thing is, I don't immediately see why it would be being cleared in the first place, aside from the sword weapon being killed during scrolling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 10:16

ah no, a couple clocks are cleared in `resetflags()`
the weapon would still be a problem though I think

=== @ Guinevere 08/28/2021 04:19

Okay. so...I have no idea what's causing this, the areas where it happens are inconsistent between quests, but are consistent in where they happen. At first I thought it was a gollab bug since the screen scrolling was tied to a scripted warp pad so i just thought that it was just not applicable to 2.55.
But apparently some quests if the screen scrolls in specific areas, ZC crashes. They don't even need to be scripted quests.
And I know that it's not just a backwards compatibility bug because it also happens in my project as well.

when fixed screen scrolling is enabled;
if there are solid combos at one edge of the screen,  and nothing on the opposite edge, it blocks link from scrolling that way where the solid combos would be like if they were on the next screen in the same position.

does it consistently do it on a specific transition?
if so, could you send a copy of the quest where you spawn in the room in question?

A warp combo that acts as a scrolling warp when you step on it, but with a defined direction. Specific use case would be doors that are away from the screen edges
Having worked with a script that does this (very jankily), I can say that this transforms how you handle dungeon design in more GB-oriented sets for the better

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/28/2021 23:53

Of course, for it to be fully feature complete, it'd need to put you on a return combo on the other side

so, a fancy version of a scrolling warp

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/28/2021 23:57

yup
Scrolling warp has a problem in that it doesn't force your direction

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 08/29/2021 00:50

Maybe it could be two combos:

1)  Side Warp Trigger - With selectors for North/East/South/West, and Screen and Dmap coordinates, as well as a numerical identifier that would be paired with the combo below.

2)  Side Warp Arrival - Mostly just acts are a receiver for the above.  Its one property is the numerical identifier.

The numerical identifier acts as a warp coordinate receiver.  So a side warp trigger combo with ID 3 would send it to a Side Warp Arrival ID 3 on that screen.

Not sure how it would handle going between two such combos though in the case of a door that goes between two combos, like most traditional north/south doors.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 08/29/2021 01:17

---
Or would it just make more sense to keep the X or Y positioning (and Z, probably.) and just go to the next available side-warp arrival combo in that direction you're already traveling in from the first screen.

Show-off. 😛   But nah, it might be a combo that triggers the screen-scroll effect earlier, closer to the middle of the screen than being right on the very edge, and can probably even dump you somewhere not on the edge of the next screen too.

1. ignore health modifier if flipper level is (x) or above
this is basically where if you give the player level 1 flippers, they can still swim but the counter drain is in play. getting the right level of flippers removes it. also, maybe a setting of 0 (or -1?) means that no flippers will stop the effect
2. (rule) disable liquid drain while holding up an item
3. i'm unsure about how to implement this elegantly, but perhaps a drain rate for the liquid that can be divided, instead of it being a binary on or off?
what can liquids even drain right now? is it only health or is it all the counters?

Changing the bomb's weapon type affects both the bomb and it's blast

=== @ P-Tux7 08/30/2021 07:44

i don't see this as an issue

<:nekoshrug:694456306060492800>
Emily told me to

=== @ P-Tux7 08/30/2021 07:45

the problem that i see is the lit bomb being able to trigger defenses but that's not what you wrote

=== @ Guinevere 08/30/2021 07:46

i mean i'm sure it gets the point across, i don't think the bomb itself should have a hitbox once a weapon type is added on to the item
seems a lil silly
<:teehee:620404816769843200>

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/30/2021 07:47

the weapon type effect should not apply to the bomb
it should still behave as a bomb

=== @ Guinevere 08/30/2021 07:48

and if the lit bomb comes into contact with an enemy, it kills the item and hurts the enemy like a normal lweapon

`int` has a legal range of "-214748.3648, 214748.3647".  However, the parser will enforce a range of "-214747.9999, 214747.9999" and truncate legal values
this is... an incredibly small bug

## ZQuest 2.55 tanking in FPS even more than 2.53 did. (#842)

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:08

So when I used 2.53, there would be this issue where the program would run at 30 FPS consistently, but when I would run a background process (A Discord VC, OBS, Steam, etc.) it would actually go _up_ to 60 for some reason. It's even worse here though, where the FPS is now locked at roughly 20 FPS when I'm not in other calls, but will not only move up to 45-50 FPS with a background process. While I have no clue what's causing the program to run better, it doesn't change that for some reason, there's a massive dip in FPS for 2.55 over 2.53.

does it flicker like the one in ZC does?
or is it a solid draw?

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:09

solid draw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:09

that being on may well be tanking your fps

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:09

wut
Any way to change that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:10

that's why the zc one flickers, to fix that problem
I'd recommend turning off the fps counter and seeing if it feels any better?

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:10

Nah, that's defo still 21 rn
yeesh

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:12

It's an issue I had for a while that I figured was just an issue with me using Windows 10 (I recall some dev discussion about it a long time ago), but since it's tanking even more it has me confused.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:12

does `frame_rest_suggest` do anything in zquest.cfg?

oh yeah
i also noticed this

and frankly, I'd expect 2.55 to be worse than 2.53, as more is going on

wait hold on

once you're dipping below 60, it's not a stretch for it to dip further

something weird

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 09:24

it's been a thing for a *while*
tbh i didn't report it bcuz a couple years ago i had a crappy laptop where everything ran slow on it. guess i was still used to the slow framerate. lol

nothing changed in at least a month should have much effect on fps

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:26

a few days meaning a couple weeks

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 09:26

mine always sits around 30fps

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:26

in this case
yeah idk what's happening

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:26

could be random video driver garbage

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:26

maybe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:26

which, would put it out of our possible control

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:27

also does the frameskip function work or what

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 09:27

a lil weird that zc player can run buttery smoof but zquest can't keep up the pace, lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:28

I mean
check the .exe sizes
ZQ is like twice as big an exe

true

fair

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:30

~~unfortunately it's now consistently around 51 instead of increasing when I have background processes but hey, 51 means I can _somewhat_ do my funky frame data stuff I wanna do in ZC better~~
I'll let ya know if more weirdness happens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:30

I don't know if this is a feature already since I haven't kept up with development, but I got the idea so I figured I should post it:

A secret flag similar to flag 16-31, but instead of changing the combo to a defined secret combo, it instead takes the screens undercombo.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 04:27

`Secret->Undercombo`, interesting idea. I added `Secret->Next` recently, so it could be implemented just as that is.

if there are solid combos at one edge of the screen, it blocks link from scrolling that way where the solid combos would be like if they were on the next screen in the same position.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/02/2021 01:50

My first idea is some kind of ability to rearrange Dmap numbers, if you create your Overworld on map 4 for example, this ability would let you toggle Map 4 back to being map 1 again, without deleting and re-pasting maps in order to achieve this. All exits and stairs created won't becomes mixed up or erased while doing this.  Notice:  >   If this is not possible, i would like the ability to rearrange Dmaps without Exits and Stairs getting mixed up or messed up by trying to sort around my Dmaps by copying and re-pasting them. The idea would be a toggle option so transport destinations don't get ruined.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Looking through the quest fil…"): They're not hover boots, although they are called such in-game.  They're a custom scripted item (I _think_ in one of the Custom Item Classes?) that prevents the player from falling into hole combos (and gives them protection from stepping on spikes with a regular "boots" item).

=== @ Mitsukara 11/05/2021 21:18

my apologies for not actually participating in 2.55 testing myself, rendering LaZPoC halfway into the realm of abandonware (neglectware?)
but if anyone has further questions on this subject I'd be happy to at least attempt to help answer
at some future time when I have more of a windows 10 setup (or if a new 2.55-or-above Linux version comes out) I'll try to actually test the quest myself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2021 21:23

@ Saffith can probably compile a linux build for you to test with, though it won't have any sound (that's currently the main linux issue)

=== @ Mitsukara 11/05/2021 21:27

oh? Well, no pressure if it'd be difficult, but that could be neat if it's easy to do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2021 21:33

as far as I know compiling it (without sound) should be as easy as compiling a build for windows... just, saff is the only one with the linux build setup, considering you need a linux machine
well, or a VM, but we don't have that set up

=== @ Mitsukara 11/05/2021 21:35

hmm, I wonder if you can compile from within a flash drive boot of Linux, without needing to make a permanent installation

=== @ Mitsukara 11/05/2021 21:37

(the way Mint and most other versions of Linux work, you just format a USB flash drive to act as a boot device, and you can run Linux from that even without a permanent installation to a hard drive. I opted to install on my hard drive as well, but you don't have to do that to run Linux)
(it was pretty fast and simple)

i dunno if you wanna detail it in the thread but i'd be interested to hear what the problem was in DM

=== @ P-Tux7 01/29/2022 22:07

Also, another quest worth looking into would be her 6th quest, since it uses much of the same ZScript functions. If it has bugs, fixing one there might fix it in Panoply. It can definitely clear your mind and make you realize a solution if you have two projects you can go back and forth between instead of focusing only on Panoply.

```-some sprite errors (sword beam break effect, ball and chain's chain)``` Fixed, Zoria was a dumbass and hardcoded default weapon sprites when the weapon creation code handled them based on item ownership and etc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 15:08

``//step = (type<2)?.5:0;`` Okay so see this
```-the candelabra only shoots two flames instead of three```
The thing that sets the default step for fire weapons is commented out
So script created fire weapons got changed to default to 0 step instead of 0.5 step, without regard for what this would break
thanks Zoria

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 15:35

I'm unsure if this is  abug or intended; autofire damage seems *really* low
lemme boot it up in 2,53

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 15:42

Okay, no, it seems intentional
I mean, they are level 1 stats

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 22:11

It's really annoying trying to debug issues introduced in early 2.53

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 19:26

```-guma's sometimes shoot straight projectiles with no set sprite instead of their "bolas"```
Fixed this; o_tile was for some reason changed to not be correctly initialized with script weapons, which would cause o_tile to either be the value of a previous weapon or random values, which tricked scripts into thinking that the weapon had been dealt with and made into a bola when in fact it hadn't

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 19:28

```-shield doesn't push urchin enemies```
```-bubbles after they finish their spawn animation stop moving/bouncing```
```-coppies copy the direction the player is facing but not the movements```
all of these are fixed, as they were the same underlying issue
and both```-the candelabra only shoots two flames instead of three```and ```-some sprite errors (sword beam break effect, ball and chain's chain)``` were fixed, as detailed above
granted, I have not yet checked the ball and chain

`Sort` will sort everything numerically
and when you sort, it takes a copy of the order it was in previously; and makes `unsort` pressable. `Unsort` will restore the previous order.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:43

It's purely visual, right? It won't fuck with the actual order?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:43

It does fuck with the actual order
there isn't a way to do it visuallyu
without completely rewriting how it works
but, `unsort` will put it back in the order it was in before you `sort`ed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:43

will it still save the order even if you go into a message string and then go out?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:43

hmm

because that would persist even if you changed quests
bleh
yeah, so just be careful not to close the dialog if you intend to unsort

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:48

oh uhh
I see what's wrong
`PriceIndex` is `-1`
so it's reading `[-1]`, out of bounds
probably grabbing the price of the 3rd item

ahhhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:48

the entire `switch(tmpscr[tmp].room)` needs to be inside an `if(PriceIndex > -1)`

```if (PriceIndex >= 0 && PriceIndex < 3) ```?

`>-1` should be sufficient
it will only ever be -1, 0, 1, 2

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "```-some sprite errors (sword…"): ...this reminds me of a more general weirdness I noticed a time or two, in 2.50.2, which I never checked if it's still in newer versions or how best to prevent it, but, sometimes when you created a LW_SCRIPT(number) weapon, it would, for one frame, have weapon sprite 1 (wooden sword) pointing north, before the graphic was set? Not sure if that's still a thing, or something I was doing wrong, it's been a long time since I poked at any of this
to the point where I'm not confident trying to post a bug report, but it might be an issue that existed, or exists

I mean... _maybe_ that made sense but it sounds kinda weird. I would think if I was nerfing it I would've gone for half-damage, or like, one level behind or something, like literally like, a flat level 1 damage no matter how much you levelled up.
Then again I defaulted to liking things tanky so I might not've even noticed and thought about it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/04/2022 01:03

(replying to @ Mitsukara "...I might've been incompeten…"): I was at level 1 at the time; it just seemed like Link was doing half the damage Zelda was doing as a partner

=== @ Mitsukara 02/04/2022 01:03

OH
okay, I think Link might have weaker swordbeams that match Zelda's arrows when he's a partner, yeah
I think that might've been part of the attempt to make Link suck less since there was a general consensus it was always better to play as Zelda
so that the actual sword does more damage when you're using it directly

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/04/2022 01:04

(replying to @ Mitsukara "I think that might've been pa…"): wow, you should have gone the opposite approach

## Allow moving item spawn position without selecting an item (#848)

=== @ Moosh 09/02/2021 10:18

This is the nittiest of nitpicks out there so keep in mind that I realize this. When you click the item square button in ZQuest it auto opens a prompt to select an item. Currently if you select (None) it treats this the same as having hit cancel. And in most cases this makes sense, if you're placing an item you probably want to place an actual item. But there is one exception to this: item cellar screen 80. In that one case, the item spawn position is used for an item set on another screen and no item will normally appear there. Whenever I set up a new screen 80, I'll just place a random item and then go back and set the screen item to (None), but since the cancel button is already a thing it'd be nice to cut out that extra step. Thoughts?

=== @ Moosh 09/02/2021 10:20

I also realize that there's no harm in leaving an item on screen 80. It'll get properly replaced. But it looks better in the editor without. Also the contents of screen 80 can still show up in quest reports, which may or may not be a bug itself

=== @ P-Tux7 09/02/2021 15:37

i'd call items an issue for quest reports, but the screen (or staircase and cave screens) can't be excluded entirely due to it having valid user-placed combos and enemies

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 04:27

this makes sense, though I could see it being annoying for some; can probably make it a ZQ config

=== @ Moosh 09/04/2021 07:07

Sounds good. Either that or a screen 80 specific exception

I'd like them to have seperate flags for letting them only/either affect the sword, hammer, or wand.

=== @ Guinevere 09/03/2021 04:49

(Tbh I want a flag where it only affects the sword but i felt that having one for all 3 would be courteous to others who'd like to choose exactly what it affects.)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 04:26

this makes sense, will just take a bit of fiddling to make sure the flags are checked by default in qst.cpp

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 04:30

having rings that affect the power of any lweapon and you could mix and match different rings and their flags for easier power upgrades/ring systems in quests instead of wasting tons of item space on a million upgrades to the items would also be neat, but i think that'll be a lil too much
so keeping it simple to just these are a good start.

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 17:25

I'm having a bug with the enemy editor. I went in to edit stats for enemies, saved the stats. Then when I went back into the enemy editor it had set its turn freq., halt rate, step speed and homing factor to 32767.

I tried this with enemies that had no scripts on them on a screen that also had no scripts on it.

I've edited ghost's shadows a little bit, but haven't touched anything else.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 18:19

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 18:31

Btw, this could be important. The only script I've added since then is the updated version of Newbie Boss. I don't think it would cause the problem though.
I had the old version and updated to the newest one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 18:32

a script literally could not cause a ZQ issue

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 18:33

That said, I've only edited a couple constants in ghost and Newbie Boss, which I can't imagine should have any effect, especially on normal enemies with no scripts on them.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 18:33

scripts don't run in ZQ
and the code to run scripts isn't even in `zquest.exe`

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 18:34

I didn't think it would. But I figured I'd at least mention the only change I've made since starting.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 22:06

...so, I edited an enemy, and instantly hit `OK`
Step speed became 1000
so I edited again, and hit `OK`
step speed became 32767, which is `MAX_SHORT`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/03/2021 23:07

Wtf

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 23:18

Yeah. That's how I felt too.
It wasn't like this 2 or 3 nightlys ago.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 23:20

Nothing about the code directly surrounding it has been changed
So either random build corruption or some weird bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 00:14

aye, should have it fixed tonight or tomorrow, hopefully
this can't be that outlandish, building it in debugger mode should lead me quickly to the issue

Okay. Thankfully there's an easy path like that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 01:21

So, I changed how `vbound` was set up internally
and it uh
was acting REALLY fucking weird
and not doing what it should have been at all
so, I re-worked it *again*
and now it is working again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 02:08

so it was working again until I tried to build it in release instead of debug
and I fucking hate C++ once again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 02:26

ok, got it fixed for real
fucking pain
will put out another build once I do a couple other things
(want to try to get the external parser working)

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/04/2021 02:29

Sounds like a pain. Weird how it would work in debug but not release. Would think it would work in both.

Not sure how feasible this is, but it would be neat as a thing in either screen data settings, or with zscript.

i'd appreciate a method where you can disable f6 but also keep death continuing

=== @ P-Tux7 09/05/2021 22:07

so that in cases like these if you try to continue you don't press start on the "go back to the file selection" prompt because you think you're gonna be able to continue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/05/2021 22:28

don't remember exactly how you'd have to set it up at the moment

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 12:26

oh, also, uh
forgot the simpler way
which is `Input->DisableKeys[]`

Input->DisableKeys[KEY_F6] = b;```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2021 23:18

You can't just bump font size, so you need to actually change the font to one that is larger
but uh
the external parser is gonna entirely change how compile errors work
...namely, they will be printed to external file, because the parser won't be part of the zquest process.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2021 00:30

. . . so now my question is
how does loading external text files for display work

and how the buffer editing works
.....and would there be a way to call that with variable font, to allow different sizes.

Ability to switch subscreen types using an Ex button 4 in game.  You could make at least 3 different subscreens that can be used for different things optional for your game, kinda like how Ocarina of time has 3 or 4 different subcreens to switch through, only you could do this in ZC.

=== @ Guinevere 09/08/2021 02:04

these enemy types are pretty infuriating for the player to deal with, so if it's possible i'd like the data of the enemy affect it in some way
examples being where the random rate can maybe affect it's fall path of going left and right, and 0 would maybe make it only fall one direction and have step speed affect how fast it falls down

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2021 02:09

a more elegant solution for your quest might be to add an npc script to be like oot
where if link has a L2 shield or better, and he's facing the rock, it kills itself and produces an effect (probably a LW_SPARKLE made to look like a shattering rock, i don't know if rocks have a normal death effect)

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2021 02:12

i like your idea but there IS one issue with it that would prevent it from being executed well
i don't know if rocks respect enemy placement flags 0-9
so a right-down moving rock might spawn on the right-top of the screen. not very effective

=== @ Guinevere 09/08/2021 02:13

well that could also be added maybe
i got no idea how to do npc scripts
and besides i think it would be beneficial for everyone to have a simpler way to make them less frustrating to deal with that everyone has access to
and i feel that what i've suggested doesn't take away the spirit of how the enemy acts
<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2021 02:15

i'm pretty sure you just add a script and you can assign it to the enemy (which also means the script can reference its parent enemy or tell it what to do)

A way to when you call a music track by script for playback, it will take priority. Meaning that it won't go back to the regular DMap track as soon as you switch screen.

Differenty priority levels on the calls would be nice:
Retain while on the same DMap or canceled by script.
Retain Globally no matter the DMap till canceled by script.
-
where did the message go?
ugh
anyway, guess I'll re type it

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/08/2021 14:01

Priority playback as an option when calling music playback via scripts. So that a track can be maintained and don't switch back to the DMap track as soon as you screen transition.

More than one priorty level would be nice too if you could set it when doing the call:
Retaining while on the same DMap till either you switch DMap or a scripts calls for the priority to be canceled (or new track to be played)

Retaining globally till a script calls for cancel or a script calls a new track.

=== @ mitchfork 09/08/2021 14:11

This would be nice. The current only way to do this is to update the dmapdata music track as well, which you then have to manually "clean up" later - often in a different script scope than you started with

ZScript needs a dedicated, well-defined RNG, maybe something from boost::random. Because its Rand() and SRand() just call the corresponding C functions, the behavior varies by platform and is affected by ZC's own use of rand().

I ran this on two different systems:
```SRand(0);
for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
    Trace(Rand(1000));```

On Windows:
```Global script 2 (RandTest): 38.0000

Global script 2 (RandTest): 238.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 437.0000

What should be done here is, add an `rng` class; maybe `randgenerator`
(to zscript)
and allow creation of multiple generators
each with their own state
and `randgenerator->Rand()`, `randgenerator->SRand()`
using some more deterministic rng on the backend as suggested

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2021 01:18

@ Saffith Mind testing for cross-platform consistency in the branch `2.55-newrand`?
if it's all good there, I can work on further zscript options, but that should cover the main engine rng being consistent.
(no need for `boost::`, since there's `<random>` in C++11+)

Build `2.55-randgen`, and run that quest in the built `zelda.exe`. It should print to console whether the RNG is consistent or not.

(also fixed the `unlink` issue for linux compile)

=== @ Saffith 09/25/2021 03:28

Didn't work, I'm afraid...
Damned if I can explain it, but apparently the only consistent function is `LRand` with no arguments.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:28

Hmm

=== @ Saffith 09/25/2021 03:28

(Also, ZScript_Additions.txt says LoadRNG is in FileSystem)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:29

Ah crap
`LRand()` is a straight call of the RNG with no filter
I think
While the rest use ` uniform_int_distribution`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:33

Yeah, that seems right
So something is off with that

=== @ Saffith 09/25/2021 03:46

I'm not sure that's meant to be deterministic. It sounds like the `mt19937` is just used to seed it. I think you just need to call `(*rng)()` and adjust the result.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:48

I need a way to make it uniform, hopefully, though

@ Saffith Use this
```cpp
int zc_rand(int upper, int lower, zc_randgen* rng)
{
    if(!rng) rng = &default_rng;
    if(lower > upper)
    {
        int t = lower;
        lower = upper;
        upper = t;
    }
    // std::uniform_int_distribution<int> dist(lower,upper);
    // return dist(*rng);
    return signed(unsigned(zc_rand(rng))%unsigned((upper-lower)+1))+lower;
}```
`random.cpp` function update
see if that works

## Rule to change NES boss HP distribution? (#867)

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:31

Some NES bosses that have multiple NPC components (Patra, Gleeok, Moldorm, Lanmola) appear to have some weird additional HP distribution mechanics that both make setting their HP in the enemy editor unintuitive and can make reading it with scripts awkward. You can see examples of enemies juggling HP values around when used in combination with my Link & Enemy Damage And Healing Numbers script

https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=364

So basically what I'd propose here is a rule that makes it so the values entering in the enemy editor are consistently treated as the HP values _per hitbox_. A Patra with an HP of 1 would have each eye die in one hit, a Gleeok would have the same HP per head and take damage linearly (instead of having heads break in weird patterns of hits like 5-3-3-3). And the segmented enemies wouldn't do whatever awkward jank they are doing.

Of course I know anything involving enemies is godawful. If this HP distribution stuff isn't something that can be reasonably modified feel free to reject in full or in part.

Also @ NightmareJames since this damage numbers bug has been a pain in both our sides with Downfall. IDK if there's any way to fix it in the script but I do imagine having these enemy types behave consistently with the rest of the engine would be a good start

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:49

It might be possible I made a stupid on that one. Would have to test. The way I remember it, setting HP on both resulted in the enemy not reflecting the values I set

=== @ Mitsukara 09/10/2021 21:37

I remember a long time ago testing if you could set Link->Jump while LA_SWIMMING was happening, and it worked pretty well as far as I could tell. So it'd be neat to have an option on Roc's Feathers where you could jump while you're in water. 

(Ideally this would be a distinct option from sideview swimming; in LA I think you could jump out of the sideview water, but not the overhead.)

=== @ P-Tux7 09/10/2021 21:46

i think there's a bigger issue in that i don't think any items can work while swimming, i know the whistle doesn't
do potions, even?

this would have been more feasible pre-a/ex1/ex2 item usage because a was just for the sword/diving

=== @ Mitsukara 09/10/2021 23:01

I guess the controls are a tricky issue. Maybe the feather could just override the dive command if it's on the same button?
once you _have_ jumped out of the water, you can use other items in midair until you fall in, and I think that worked okay when I tried it

So NightmareJames just ran into this one in Level 6 of ZNR, in the boss key room, during a stream. Went downstairs to collect a boss key, without killing all of the CSet 9 Keese in the room.
This was a brown dungeon with many dark rooms in an NES-tileset quest, so these Keese were colored black to blend in with the darkness in the room. Upon exiting the item cellar, the Keese in the (upstairs) dungeon room had picked up the CSet 9 from the item cellar's level palette, which was cyan like the Level 1 palette in the classic tileset, making the Keese no longer blend in with the darkness.

FFC Freeform Combos Need More Drawover Layers

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/887274595663630377/887274630920962088/unknown.png)
There is only 1 Drawover layer, but i need it some levels higher.

=== @ mitchfork 09/14/2021 12:51

actually would be nice to be able to set FFC layer

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/14/2021 13:35

not happening until rewrite
adding more flags to ffcs costs too much memory

=== @ mitchfork 09/14/2021 14:03

rip

=== @ P-Tux7 09/14/2021 18:21

...could we make one of the arbitrary FFC arguments used to determine what layer it is?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/14/2021 18:41

It'd be hacky but better than nothing
Maybe a QR that enables an Init Data field which lets you set which of the argument #s determines the layer of the FFC
Or just a QR hardcoding it to the last argument

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/14/2021 18:59

beyond the ffc stuff, it would take a lot of fucking with draw shit
I'd really rather not until rewrite

## More NPC Touch Effect Counters (#879)

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:11

In the enemy editor, there's a field for "Touch Effects" on the Walking Enemy type. Options include "Drain Rupees" (although a negative number will actually increase the rupees), as well as "Drain Life" and "Drain Magic". Can this be easily expanded to do things like Drain/Increase CR_SCRIPT1, etc?

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:13

Might warrant a separate request, but, it would also be neat if there was a "stun Link" option which just prevented Link movement (like NoAction()) for a certain amount of time, but ideally in a way where Link won't get stunned before he can move again. However, something like that could also be left to scripting.

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:15

Neither of these are high priority, but if it's easy to add it'd be neat.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 02:20

`Link->Defense[]` has a stun option
although I think that's only partially implemented (i.e. script only) at the moment? ( @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) any info on that? )
more touch drain options would make total sense

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/15/2021 02:30

Link->Defense is implemented in the UI
jman did that
It's under Quest->Player

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 02:33

Ah nice
That's the answer for the stun part, @ Mitsukara

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:35

Cool
Pushing my luck on this general subject... does it sound complicated to make these touch effects be applicable to weapons?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 02:37

Weapons should frankly be easy... but enemy/item attributes to set the weapons is a chunk more work.
(Neither out of the question; though I'd make a separate thread for that)

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 03:26

Couldn't one just have two checkboxes for the drain effect to apply to enemy touch, enemy weapon, both, or none?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 03:29

Firstly, that still needs adding vars. Checkboxes or dropdowns, still adding stuff. 
Secondly, then the next feature request that comes in is "hey I want to be able to have the touch drain X and the weapon drain Y"

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 03:35

I don't particularly care if it can just be scripted anyways (similar to curse effects on non-walking enemies and eweapons)

=== @ Alucard648 09/15/2021 17:59

What about  also add siilar expansion to eating enemies - Eat(Ccounter XX)?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 18:27

hmm can script reads of link's eaten status read WHICH enemy id he is being eaten by?

=== @ Alucard648 09/15/2021 22:12

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "hmm can script reads of link'…"): ```//Returns pointer to NPC that has eaten hero. Otherwise returns invalid pointer.
npc EatenBy(){
    if (Hero->Eaten) return;
    for (int i=1; i< Screen->NumNPCs();i++){
        npc n = Screen->LoadNPC(i);
        if ((n->X == Hero->X)&&(n->Y == Hero->Y)) return n;
    }
    return;
}```

As of 2.55 latest alpha.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 22:15

is there not a `HasLink` or somesuch readable on enemies?
(There *is* internally, so, would not be difficult to add if it's missing)

=== @ Alucard648 09/15/2021 22:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "is there not a `HasLink` or s…"): No such thing, as of latest alpha.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 22:23

1. Add more counters to touch effect drain
2. Add `bool npc->HasLink;`, read-only, to zscript
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
(your method might fail if multiple enemies are at the exact same x/y, this new addition would prevent that)
## ✅🔒Fairy spawn limitations (#880)

Status: fixed

Labels: ['bug']

Source: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/887599395028213791



=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 07:23

ZC has some sort of limitation that makes it so a second fairly will not spawn* if there is a second fairy onscreen, even with a 100% item drop rate for just a fairy (moving; haven't tried stationary). 

 (* - _Usually, inconsistently_. Sometimes I could only get one to spawn, sometimes a second one would appear, but definitely not more than 2).

This may be a deliberate bit of code to try to simulate some sort of NES limitation (though it's not even accurate at that because you can have at least two fairies in Zelda 1), but it doesn't make sense / might warrant some kind of QR change or something. 

~~(Why do I have a feeling this is one of those "a previous dev had a hard-on for difficulty" bits of code, like the thing about not letting people use that one cheats program....)~~

However, spawning at least 3 fairies with FFC scripts works normally as expected, thankfully. So this is just something about how they work as item drops.

Was discussed here (found by P-Tux): https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/887461043117391872/887550177739694102

Note: This isn't a new bug, and I haven't confirmed it still works this way in 2.55 (though I would think P-Tux would know if it didn't?). Only tested it in 2.50.2 linux myself.

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 07:53

i think zelda 1 has a 1 fairy limit - if a fairy is on-screen, no enemies will drop fairies until that one is gone
and the other fairies spawning are when two fairy-spawning enemies are killed on the same frame, meaning that both checks for a fairy on-screen fail
it takes some careful practice or luck to perform, which is probably why phantom menace thought that 1 fairy was the limit

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 19:00

I suppose it makes some sense but it'd be nice to have the option to disable it for modern quests, at least.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 19:07

probably something to do with the fact that fairies are both an enemy and an item

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 17:04

this is pain
fairies are hardcoded
this is a feature request to surpass ~~metal gear~~ sideview swimming

Fixed; also have a new QR as well to let fairies spawn with different directions cause that annoyed me
(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒Fairy spawn limitations
@ Mitsukara the real reason this was implemented the way it was was because the item just grabbed the first fairy enemy on screen to attach itself to it
so I had to rewrite how fairies worked to let multiple exist

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 19:58

Why are fairies enemies?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 19:59

because moving

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 19:59

I understand they're Guys but enemy Goriyas and Guy Goriyas are different
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "because moving"): I'd have thought they would be an LWeapon in that case

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 19:59

guy fairies and item fairies are differnet too
lweapons don't have movement behaviors other than straight line

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:00

boomerangs?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 20:00

that's straight line, and when it dies, straight line
to add proper movement behaviors and the variables to store that it'd need to be a subclass of weapon
which would be annoying
as all `lweapon`/`eweapon` are a single class, no subclasses

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:01

okay so what did dimi turn the fairies into now?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 20:01

nothing changed
it's just that it no longer just grabs the first fairy enemy on screen for every fairy
it actually makes separate ones for each

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:09

well that's going in the lttp tileset
always-spawn-fairy combos like in the eastern palace pots

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:45

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "always-spawn-fairy combos lik…"): they also no longer default to facing up with a new QR
that annoyed me when I made lttp-styled fairy fountains in HF

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:47

wait how'd you do it if more than one fairy couldn't exist

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:48

literally had to rewrite the system to give each fairy item a value that stores it's enemy counterpart

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:48

no i meant in HF

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:48

See here's the weird thing
the limitation for some reason doesn't exist for scripts
and I don't know why

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:48

that *works*?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:48

yeah
but the code seemed to suggest that it wouldn't

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:49

i'd have thought zc would just start crying if ordered to make multiple fairies

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:49

it's possible the limitation is just poor understanding on my part
but uh, the math used for tying fairies to enemies was fuckin weird
glad it's deprecated

=== @ P-Tux7 09/16/2021 15:36

Guys are already editable in the 2.55 alphas. This allows for you to, for example, change Ama to CSet 7 like in BS Zelda with no scripting or 8-bit mode. I would like to request this to be retained, and for them to be renamed to "Goriya (Guy)" etc. to reduce confusion.
Something else that might also be cool is to allow rooms to have the room's Guy selector read all "Guy" enemies from the enemy list, and allow you to select one, allowing for custom Guys.  I know a lot of people just use invisible Guys and make the graphics as tiles so the Guys don't disappear, but I know users like NightmareJames like to use real Guys and even use scripts to change the room's Guy graphic.

=== @ P-Tux7 09/16/2021 15:47

Or in worst-case scenario, just entering the ID # of the enemy to be the Guy. Though it's not idiot-proof

also `guys.cpp` is everything enemy related, not just room guys

=== @ P-Tux7 09/16/2021 17:47

i mean if what setting a guy in the list does is puts a numerical ID in the room as to what enemy to use, then a dialog box that allows setting that would allow for non-default guys

=== @ 4matsy 09/16/2021 17:47

Ah, so that's why the guys were made editable along with the enemies. I was wondering about that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 17:47

guys are jankily made part of enemies
even though they shouldn't realistically be remotely related
because, you know, jank jank mcjank jank

=== @ P-Tux7 09/16/2021 17:54

i mean they do have enemy-like features
they poof in, they can be "hurt", they count as enemies for purposes of door opening (feed the goriya, life or money etc.)

oh, is it a windows only issue, just like the sprite invisibility?
that sounds fucking fun

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:41

Yep, seems to be.
And it's pretty simple, so I have no clue what the problem could be.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:41

oh ffs
question
you changed some function pointer stuff to no longer use `(*func)(params)` but instead `func(params)`
I'm guessing that's a c++ change?
I'm guessing something to do with `==` on func pointers is different
which would break `large_dialog()`

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:42

No, that was to do with the new ListData.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:42

and likely cause something approximately like this
oh
hmmm

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888230580855136327/888240145453694996/unknown.png)
well it appears not to be broken in small mode
so my suspicion of `large_dialog` seems correct

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:07

hmm,no
they are *only* broken in the init data dlg
wtf
only in init data, and only in large mode....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:11

. . .
and ONLY in ZQ
the same fucking dialog launched via the cheats menu in ZC
fucking works fine
WHAT THE SHIT

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:13

. . .I just have no clue
This does not make sense
whatsoever
the code is shared between ZC and ZQ
and the large_dialog code is shared by multiple dialogs
only this dialog, only in ZQ, is affected
this should *not be possible*
.....I have a fucking jank way to fix it, which I'm gonna do
(just remove the frames)

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:15

Have you tried rebuilding from scratch to rule out some sort of build error?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:15

aye, multiple times
that's always the *first* thing I try

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:16

Welp, that's the only logical explanation I had.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:16

I would say cosmic rays
but uh
that would need to be occurring every single time
which uh, not likely
there is no logical explaination for this, it is the new boogie-man
...time to jank around it.
(Replacing the init data dialog with a new gui system thing at some point would be wonderful)
(though, needs a lot of stuff)

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:18

Well, good excuse to do it.

looks a bit odd with the frames missing
but, for now, it will do
that gui will be a mountain of a project to rewrite, considering it's >3k indexes
but, a lot of that is generated in a loop
for the LItem stuff
....could probably do that in some saner way

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 06:17

the quests that were using the sounds default of the previous default module have been changed with the sounds of the new module

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 12:38

Don't know if this is a bug,but deserves a mention.  Second

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 14:29

???????

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 19:09

Since the new module changes the default sound effects, quests that used the previous default sound effects are now using the new ones.

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 19:11

So in laments terms
Zelda 1 sounds got turned into Koten sounds

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 19:12

sfx should be stored in the quest file
this points to a serious underlying problem

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 20:15

Good thing we reported it then

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 20:15

indeed
people can sorta fix it by going back to the previous module but it's still pretty weird that the sfx aren't tied to the quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:22

The problem I see here is this may not be fully fixable, depending on the exact nature of the problem
because to fix it may *require* a quest be re-saved
unless it stores the appropriate sfx, and is just *ignoring* them for the module, which is possible; I haven't looked into it yet

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 20:24

Hey @EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) , can we get together in the server's voice chat for a minute?  General1?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:25

give me a few, just got done with a super difficult run of a game that I've been doing for *hours*

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 20:25

OK

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:43

. . .
so no one is gonna like this
but it's literally not fixable
the SFX for the ones from sfx.dat are literally not being saved in the qst file
so old quests literally don't have anything in them in those slots
meaning either we need to include the copyrighted sfx in the default package *forever*
or break sfx in old quests
both of which are "unacceptable" outcomes
catch-22 situation, nothing we can do
....I can fix this for quests that are *re-saved in a new build*
but can't do anything more

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 20:46

mmm
that is pretty problematic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:47

gonna have to discuss with devs on course of action here
because either we break old quests
or we postpone being copyright-free until the rewrite

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 20:53

i mean
i know my two-sense isn't the strongest in terms of development discussions like this
but i think it would be much less of a headache if you postpone until the rewrite, since one of the main focuses of 2.55 is backwards compatibility with all the quests that were made in the previous versions
it keeps priorities of what you want to do with both 2.55 and the rewrite intact

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 21:13

https://youtu.be/WGWweXnW__w This is the bug in action (including a custom SFX in action)

=== @ vlamart 09/17/2021 22:27

If I work on a sfx library, should I follow the "tracklisting" in the constants doc?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:28

what listing?
The `SFX_` constants?

=== @ vlamart 09/17/2021 22:29

Yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:29

probably
scripts may potentially expect them to be as-is
and most questmakers keep their sfx in the same order as default for ease of use

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:38

May just be a bug with the Koten file included, when I hit Authentic NES when making a new quest, the water is not solid as it should be.

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:41

Trying the same in 2.53 implies it may be an issue with the template dialog though. Also solidity preview in 2.53 shows a teal color for walkable water with the rule off, yet the latest nigtly has it unmarked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:43

Water has never been *made solid* by rulesets
it is made *non-solid* by the more modern rulesets
but nothing has *ever* made it solid

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:43

Sorry the correct wording is it is not _left_ solid by the template dialog 🤦

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:43

oh
tis quite different

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:44

So either it was never solid to begin or the template code that makes it walkable runs every time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:44

would guess never solid to begin with
because that code only exists in the blocks for the newer rulesets
and all instances of that code would pop up asking you for confirmation of converting the water
so if you get no pop-up asking `"Convert all water to non-solid?"` then it isn't doing anything

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:45

No pop-up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:45

then aye, it just isn't solid in that tileset

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:45

But hitting no on the popup still leaves it walkable
Odd that it's that way in both the 2.55 and 2.53 defaults

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:46

Fun thing is it never used to have a popup even though it always has done that conversion, as far back as 2.50.2

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:46

Anyways, I'm meaning to comb over all ZQuest dialogues I can and report any oddities I find

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:48

Finished looking over ZQuest, only a couple things in the GUIs stood out as out of place:
```-Pickup flags in the item editor still has that big honkin' checkbox next to it
-SFX menu flickers when pressing the play button sometimes
-Background bezel on the side warp menu is mis-sized```
Here's what side warp triggers look like now

see how this menu isn't fucked up
makes me so confused

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:27

I think it's affecting every `jwin_frame_proc` in ZQuest, and some are just more obvious than others.

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:28

That's not a textbox. It's just a frame with text inside.

the `Music.nsf` box?

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:28

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 03:28

huh
that makes sense then
but I know I opened some places that use frame and didn't see it

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:30

Are you sure it was in ZQuest? ZC seems to be unaffected.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 03:33

I could swear at least 2 spots in zq had no issue
but could have just been non-noticable
so, it's only in ZQ, and only in large mode
that points to `zq_custom.cpp` `large_dialog()`

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:36

Hm... The secret combos dialog looks weirdly okay.
Nothing's off by even a pixel.
`large_dialog(secret_dlg,1.75);`
... Is 1.75 okay, but 1.5 isn't?

hmm, that's odd

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 23:54

wh-what

Not sure why that's allowed.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 23:55

C++ what the shit is this
```cpp
// Identical to jwin_frame_proc, but is treated differently by large_dialog()
int d_comboframe_proc(int msg, DIALOG *d, int c)```
fucking
wtf

Also, by specifying the /OPT:ICF switch, the linker will fold identical functions and global constant variables.
So I guess that's enabled somehow.

This one's happening on Linux, too. I'll see if I can find anything.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:16

It could be something to do with the massive memory allocation/deallocation being slower for some reason
keep in mind that it generates and destroys 32 lweapons per frame
which all have a *full script stack* attached
.....should probably make it so the script stack only allocates the memory if it is going to be used.
.........for all sprite types......
which sounds like a fun adventure
might not be the only issue, though; could be something else at play

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:19

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "keep in mind that it generate…"): that's a funny way to do it

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:20

i thought it just moves the the lweapons just moved away from link until they hit the radius
<:derp:675738486397206578>

until i saw how slow it ran and you could see them replace themselves in slow motion

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:22

Nope, it generates new ones each frame; that's why they appear to not die on hitting enemies

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:22

i see
that's one way to do it
if that's the case how do things like piercing arrows and beams work?
do they work the same way?
or candle flames for that matter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:27

Those won't pierce an enemy with "Block" defense
Din's, pretty sure would

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:32

2 things to definitely help this:
- compat QR for old behavior, make new behavior where it moves the flames instead of creating new ones; needs new pierce behavior
- Make memory for script info only be allocated when it is first needed, not on sprite creation. This way unscripted sprites don't need to alloc/dealloc those. A simple `sprite::allocscript()` function to allocate the memory if and only if the pointers are null, and deallocating appropriately in the destructor, would fix this. This should lower lag of all sprite types significantly, including fixing particle effects.
Those are both just general optimizations though
not sure if there's a specific issue with C++17 that should also be corrected here

Adding a general weapon piercing property, which could be script-readwrite, would be useful for the former; `*weapon->Pierce`. Would be `int`, with `0 = no pierce`, `1 = standard pierce`, `2 = pierce even block defense enemies`; 2 being what dins effectively does now

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:36

Looks like it's spending the bulk of its time in `sprite::draw()`.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:36

Oh?
That seems fun
And not what either of my optimizations would target
Does it occur with the compat QR `Old (Faster) sprite draws` enabled?

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:39

Haven't checked that, but I'm betting it does...
Looks like it's mainly `dithercircfill`, called from `doDarkroomCircle`.
`ditherblit`, in particular.
And that's mainly `getpixel`.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:41

Oh fun
Darkroom functions don't have a check to only run in darkrooms
That'd do it
And fire weapons have light radius by default
That's my bad

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:44

Yeah, it's a bit late for all that.

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:48

In a quick test of just picking up Din's Fire and using it twice, `getpixel` accounted for ~35% of the program's total run time.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:49

That's used in the dithering functions

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:49

Yeah. If there's any way you can cut down on it..

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:50

Not really... unless you want to look at optimizing the `drawing.cpp` stuff while having the same visual effect
But, making it only run when it actually is in a dark room will help a lot

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 05:17

I see almost no framerate hit by doing this:
```cpp
#include <allegro/internal/aintern.h>
void ditherblit(BITMAP* dest, BITMAP* src, int color, byte dType, byte dArg, int xoffs, int yoffs)
{
    int wid = zc_min(dest->w, src->w);
    int hei = zc_min(dest->h, src->h);
    for(int ty = 0; ty < hei; ++ty)
    {
        uintptr_t addr = bmp_read_line(src, ty);
        for(int tx = 0; tx < wid; ++tx)
        {
            if(bmp_read8(addr+tx) && dithercheck(dType,dArg,tx+xoffs,ty+yoffs,wid,hei))
            {
                putpixel(dest, tx, ty, color);
            }
        }
        bmp_unwrite_line(src);
    }
}
```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 05:18

I don't recognize any of those functions
But if it works smoother, then yes please
Does it respect the clipping rect of the dest?
Wait that's all on the src
So duh the dest code didn't change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 14:33

K
\#3 - saff's fix- is implemented, and works beautifully
also simultaneously made it so none of that shit runs if the screen isn't dark
or new darkrooms aren't enabled

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 14:47

Using `->Explode(2)`, running it a bunch of times per frame, I can cause this:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888637215637385226/888798434772025424/unknown.png)
which, is a solid FREEZE on trying to scroll screens, due to massive memory dealloc
optimization 2 should target this type of lag directly, so time to test that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:07

...well, it doesn't do as much as expected for this particular usecase
and took far more work than expected
but it should in theory be working now
....particles really still need to become a separate class, and not `: public sprite`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:13

. . . wait wtf
So, on optimization `1.` .... I appear to be wrong?
It appears to only generated the flames once, not each frame

ooh better din's fire now?
better as in can be blocked and doesn't spawn every frame

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:22

1. Dark rooms no longer run their drawing code when you aren't in a dark room
2. Dithered drawing is now just faster fps-wise, thanks to Saff's code
3. Sprites no longer generate script data if they aren't using it
Apparently it didn't spawn every frame? And I'm very confused by this?
Or if it is, I don't see any possible way the code that spawns it could be doing that, so

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:22

something i'd appreciate is a way to spawn the ring of fire routine without the actual item

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:23

?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:23

i.e. for a book fire effect, or an enemy making a ring of fire
some way to spawn it with a radius argument

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:23

blehg
far too much work

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:23

no sorry i meant
SCRIPT ONLY

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:24

so a script being able to just spawn a ring of fire?
That's a ridiculously easy thing to do in zscript
```cpp
for(int flamecounter=((-1)*(flamemax/2))+1; flamecounter<=((flamemax/2)+1); flamecounter++)
{
    Lwpns.add(new weapon((zfix)LinkX(),(zfix)LinkY(),(zfix)LinkZ(),wFire,itemsbuf[magicitem].fam_type,itemsbuf[magicitem].power*game->get_hero_dmgmult(),
                         isSideViewGravity() ? (flamecounter<flamemax ? left : right) : 0, magicitem, Link.getUID(), false, 0, 0, 0, itemsbuf[magicitem].family));
    weapon *w = (weapon*)(Lwpns.spr(Lwpns.Count()-1));
    w->step=(itemsbuf[magicitem].misc2/100.0);
    w->angular=true;
    w->angle=(flamecounter*PI/(flamemax/2.0));
}
```
that's the internal code
converting it to ZScript should be relatively easy
the `Lwpns.add` is just a `CreateLWeapon` that sets a bunch of the variables
and the actual ring is done by the `->angular`/`->angle` calcs
so like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:28

```cpp
void spawnFireRing(int x, int y, int dmg, int stp, int numflames)
{
    for(int flamecounter=((-1)*(numflames/2))+1; flamecounter<=((numflames/2)+1); flamecounter++)
    {
        lweapon weap = Screen->CreateLWeapon(LW_FIRE);
        weap->X = x;
        weap->Y = y;
        weap->Damage = dmg;
        weap->Step = stp;
        weap->Angular = true;
        weap->Angle = ((flamecounter*PI)/(numflames/2));
    }
}```
there you go

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:28

thank you!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:28

that doesn't set some of the vars the internal one does, like the parent item
but you wouldn't want those
oh wait, let me make an ew version

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:29

```cpp
void spawnLWRing(int x, int y, int dmg, int stp, int numweaps, int type)
{
    for(int count=((-1)*(numweaps/2))+1; count<=((numweaps/2)+1); count++)
    {
        lweapon weap = Screen->CreateLWeapon(type);
        weap->X = x;
        weap->Y = y;
        weap->Damage = dmg;
        weap->Step = stp;
        weap->Angular = true;
        weap->Angle = ((count*PI)/(numweaps/2));
    }
}
void spawnEWRing(int x, int y, int dmg, int stp, int numweaps, int type)
{
    for(int count=((-1)*(numweaps/2))+1; count<=((numweaps/2)+1); count++)
    {
        eweapon weap = Screen->CreateEWeapon(type);
        weap->X = x;
        weap->Y = y;
        weap->Damage = dmg;
        weap->Step = stp;
        weap->Angular = true;
        weap->Angle = ((count*PI)/(numweaps/2));
    }
}```
woo there you go, LW and EW version, and I made it take any weapon type

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:30

err, it doesn't
stop moving

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:34

you could also add a `script`/`InitD` param
to assign a script and init values to each weapon
which could be used for stopping them moving after a certain time
or doing any number of other effects
as it's a ZScript function, the number of ways you could simply modify it is endless

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/18/2021 17:08

I would formally like to ask about adding more fonts to the string editor and I personally happen to have a huge collection of fonts from various games, including Castlevania 3 - Dracula's Curse, Chrono Trigger and a few others. Here's the DL File for my personal font collection: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VQ0wm05uV8EQVqXrzeklGwviaUHQUZSF/view?usp=sharing
@<role: Developer> Heads up!

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 17:09

@ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) I vaguely recall you showing off screenshots of a build that had more fonts and I'm pinging you because I still kinda want the actual Castlevania 3 font in ZC
Please reply to this thread when you can.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 00:20

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:05

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:06

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "mind if I paged <@!2424224362…"): I do not  mind,but even if I did it isn't my server so as  long as it is permitted do as you wish.

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/05/2021 07:07

aye

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:07

It's about one total day of work to add this feature.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:09

I may just bake it into fonts.dat as ten user fonts and be done

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:10

I do however think that a custom userfonts is best with a command to load it n ZScript so that you can hot swap fonts adhoc.
this would allow a lot of freedom but it needs a lot  of GUI shyte in ZQE to support it

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:14

as it is not up to me now I do not have say on if this is going to be included if I make it and I want assurance that it will, ere I waste time creating it
I short I will not even begin on such a task unless the concept is preapproved.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:14

The question I have is, how much would it add to embed a few custom fonts in the .qst?
like how SFX are loaded?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:15

how much what?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:15

would that add too much bloat to the quest file?
if not, I feel like that would be a far better system

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:15

Fonts are bitmap images
you'd store tem externally
but if you do tat tewn ZQ cannot preview te messages

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:16

Why couldn't they be stored internally though?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:16

hence why I thought that a ten font userfonts.dat was the best solution

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:16

just write the contents of the bitmap to the quest file, `pfwrite()`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:16

I suppose they could
but that has the same problem
https://www.allegro.cc/manual/4/api/fonts/load_font
if you have a better idea there is the documentaton

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:17

I mean, it can `write_bitmap()` to a tempfile and then load the tempfile
if the load_font requires it be a file

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:17

that only supports GRX
IDK if the fonted output would wor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:18

`or any bitmap format that can be loaded by load_bitmap()`
if you read the full sentence

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:18

and again, there is the string editor and te subscreen to cnsider

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:18

`a GRX format .fnt file, a 8x8 or 8x16 BIOS format .fnt file, a datafile or any bitmap format that can be loaded by load_bitmap().`
For string editor/subscreen, the user fonts would just be appended to the dropdown lists

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:18

Sure
I do not ind this
but it reuires team effort
not e alone sitting and doing it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:19

aye, certainly

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:19

and the complications of working with an eternal repo pus the new vs version mean it won't happen fast
coding this is not that hard
for the basic font loading
I'd do it in ZScript first
then you can add the other crud
incuding the file sel dialogue to add a font
it will need a somewhat complex dialogue including storing a font name and a pulldown for the slot (1 to 10)
and will further deprecate Tango to a point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:22

well, it'd be kinda like the `SFX` dialog

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:22

so that is a bonus

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:22

you select a slot to edit, then name it and load a file

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:22

sure
I just want a team effort to add that jank

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:22

should be fairly simple, though I'll want to build it in the new system, so won't just be pure copy+paste on the sfx one

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:23

Adding a major feature like this is not something I a wiling to do solo
I am more than happy to do the skeleton implementation at some point and let you do all of the GUI crud

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:25

I still need to do the basic ffscript stuff fr rgbdata and palette
so I need to reserve registers and ASM opcodes for my use
first
twenty to thirty
I don't want to resolve erge conflicts on an external repo and futz about

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:27

in general when anything artificially pads a task to increase the amount of required time I just say no.
so reserving these allows me to avoid merge conficts
and thus not waste time

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 15:24

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "would that add too much bloat…"): i can't imagine so
allegro fonts are 1-bit images
i'm sure one page of 8-bit tiles would take the same amount of room as 10 or even 20 allegro fonts

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 15:26

and it should add almost zero bloat if the user does not ADD any, just like sfx and 8-bit tiles

The way that boomerang and hookshot grabbing items works in zc is not intuitive and is very limiting. It would make a lot of sense to just have a `Grab-able` flag for each item that determines if they can be grabbed by the boomerang and hookshot or something similar.

This would make lock blocks capable of changing and being dependant on ScreenD values. I can see a variety of possible uses here.

=== @ bigjoe 09/20/2021 04:27

If I could give examples. You might use strings to initiate the thought of getting a key from a bucket which could later be used on a lock block on the screen. Or you could have gathering mini games of sorts.

=== @ bigjoe 09/20/2021 08:07

=== @ Bagu 09/20/2021 16:52

I wrote a very simple function for RPG  quests, that can check the selected character and exchange the active subscreen, depending on it.

So I just thought it would be nice, if there was a Quest Script Option, that allows to instantly update the active subscreen Application (on every frame) if writing to "DMapData->ActiveSubscreen".
...without warping or scrolling to reinitiate the actual screen

=== @ mitchfork 09/21/2021 16:47

This is from a discussion in the Z-Zone scripting discussion channel with @ Lejes
In `__AutoGhostParseName()` there is a for loop to go through the NPC name string - there is a `return 1;` line that will always execute before the for loop finishes
this messes up AutoGhost in 2.55

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2021 17:02

....and it doesn't mess it up in 2.53?

=== @ mitchfork 09/21/2021 17:04

Haven't checked the file in 2.53
It looks like it would have the same bug
seems like to me that the `return 1;` should be inside an `else` but I'm not certain

## ✅🔒std_functions.zh - Off by 1 error in collision detecting functions (#897)

=== @ Alucard648 09/21/2021 22:10

In all Collision functions all hitboxes are extended 1 pixel rightwards and 1 pixel downwards. Here is the example from std_functions.zh.
```

// Returns true if there is a collision between Link's hitbox and the FFC's.
// This only checks hitboxes.
bool LinkCollision(ffc f) 
{
    int ax = Link->X + Link->HitXOffset;
    int ay = Link->Y + Link->HitYOffset;
    return RectCollision(f->X, f->Y, f->X+(f->TileWidth*16), f->Y+(f->TileHeight*16), ax, ay, ax+Link->HitWidth, ay+Link->HitHeight);
}```
Here Hero`s default hit box counts as 17 pixels long, not 16 and 9 pixels high, not 8. In case of 1x1 FFC, its hitbox treated by function as 17x17 pixels, not 16x16 as intended. And that imprecision is across all collision detection functions in std.zh

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/24/2021 23:34

This just occurred to me and I think it would be great if this was an engine side feature but the default slash in Zeldaclassic is the GB Zelda 45 degree slash and it would be great as either a QR or sword exclusive item attribute to have 90 degree slashes ala ALTTP.

iirc zoria planned to add this but we couldn't find the hitbox size for each frame even after asking on zeldix

still it'd probably be hard since lttp had two different sword lengths that people would want

If someone wants to fully document the code for how Z3 handles slashes and the sprites and timing, then K could do it with a 1:1 conversion. I  do not want to implement a shoddy or inaccurate emulation of it in ZC.

What you like or dislike is not in debate. I happen to prefer both over zc, but I was more used to both ere either *existed* in zc.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/24/2021 18:13

btw something you *can* do is port the variable length property of Z3 swords to the current sword
since iirc hitboxes for them are extremely hardcoded rn and don't respect the input value in the item editor

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 18:17

I could, but I won't.
If I am going to do tqt I want to do it all at one time, or not at all.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 18:20

Adding hotbox sizing to base swords is far from trivial
If I had all the metrics for z3 I would have done all of it for the z360 lwpn
Or z3slash
Or whatever I called it

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 18:22

Without the metrics and frame details, if fell to the bottom of my list. scripts allow implementation of it by anyone who wants to try and if they provide the script then  we could add I to future engine versions.

variables are not constant

`10*4` are both number literals

That's a `const int`
a constant, not a variable

so this would never work: const int ArraySize = ArrayWidth * ArrayHeight;

if `ArrayWidth` and `ArrayHeight` are constants, it would
```cpp
const int WIDTH = 5;

const int SIZE = WIDTH*HEIGHT;
int arr[SIZE];```
that works fine

=== @ OmegaX 09/25/2021 04:45

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "if `ArrayWidth` and `ArrayHei…"): those two variables are not constant in my script...
RoomWidth = TempRoomX2 - TempRoomX1;
RoomHeight = TempRoomY2 - TempRoomY1;
const int ArrayWidth = RoomWidth / SCREEN_W;
const int ArrayHeight = RoomHeight / SCREEN_H;
const int ArraySize = ArrayWidth * ArrayHeight;
int TempRoomArray[ArraySize];

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 04:46

then yep, that won't work there
the value needs to be constant at compile time

I will tell you, making an array really big doesn't hurt that much at all
so you can just make them really big

Can I create an array, fill it up to a certain point (for ex: array size being 30 and the point we fill it up too is up to entry 10, with the other 20 being empty or 0) and then copy that array onto empty variable with only those filled in values (essentially another array with a size of 10)?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 05:02

. . . how would you size that other array any differently?
Anyway, when you create an array, everything in it is 0 by default

Well I’m out of ideas...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 05:04

....just make it bigger than you need it to be?
What is the biggest it could ever need to be?
Or if you need all the space, just make it sized `MAX_INT`

=== @ OmegaX 09/25/2021 05:15

May I ask why ZC can't use variables to define array size? (being able to do something like would be really useful)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 05:28

because it uses the size during compile
it might be able to be changed, but it wouldn't work well with global arrays, which would be problematic and/or require additional error checking, which is a bunch of work to do.

and the "blocked" effect (boomerang on edge of screen or shooting an arrow at a darknut)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 04:31

The `iwDeath` sprite only reads the tile, nothing else. So the frame count/speed is hard-coded.
to fix this without giving enemies custom death sprites per-enemy would be stupid... so this'll be fixed whenever the energy to add that is found

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 03:58

so
firstly

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892258891084234762/unknown.png)
this won't fix the frames, but lets you pick what sprite you want

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 04:10

Thank you. I take it that it will be tonight's nightly build?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 04:11

still working on fixing the frames part

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 04:11

I see...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:09

@ FireSeraphim if you wouldn't mind testing this out

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:09

Honestly I'm not a coder by any means.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:09


https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892276911571599380/buildpack.zip
not necessarily the script part
There's a QR under `Backwards compat -> 3` for changing the hardcoded frames
and the enemy editor `Graphics->Sprites` tab for changing the sprites on enemies without scriptsw

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:11

I'll test the QR thing. I'm not interested in driving myself mad by trying to manually set each enemy's death sprite to a new one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:12

as long as it fixes the issue you reported

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:21

I'm testing it now. I'll let you how it pans out on that front

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:22

The ability to switch the sprite was the easy part, so frankly I don't expect issues with that at all
but the animation frames stuff is janky AF
thankfully if it works in once place it should work in all since it's the same code

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:23

It works on my end. Now I just need to tweak the death animation to not play so fast

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:23

woo
it played fast, that's a good sign
guessing the speed was 0?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:24

I had the speed on six for a nine frame animation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:24

ah, you had edited it
that's about half a second for the whole anim
...given, the engine one only ran for 18 frames
if I read this right anyway
I'll leave this open marked sick for a bit in case any issues come up with it

Now I can't help but to wonder if I'm doing it wrong on my end.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:29

oh?
What's your setup

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:29

9 frames, speed of 12 (and the animation still seems to play too fast from what I'm seeing)
(replying to @ FireSeraphim "As a test, I recommend starti…"): These are the sprites I'm using

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:30

this is unchecked?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:30

Yep

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:33

Is a lower number the way to go for a slower animation? Just now tried it with the frame speed set to 16 as a brute force measure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:33

lower is faster
I noticed something wrong
one moment

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892283008122499072/zelda.exe
try that
(I thought the sprite anim clock was counting up.... turns out it was counting *down*, so something was set up backwards... oops)

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:39

Nope. Just now set the animation frame speed to eight and it's still playing too fast

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:39

Really?

...wtf
....not gonna get this done tonight.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:16

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) I did some further testing
It only seems to affect my quest
Link seems to appear just fine in other quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:18

...load an older backup of your quest?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:18

I am temporarily re-enabling the QR for backwards compatibility
just to see if it fixes that anomalous behavior
and then I'll load an older copy of my project afterwards as a futher test

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:23

loaded and tested the copy I sent you at 'round midnight and the same phantom elf problem persists

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:24

Did the QR fix it?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:24

Nope
I did some futher tentative experiementation and link and the enemy and item sprites are invisible. I can seemingly still move the invisible elf into new screens and all
the items aren't invisible in the subscreens.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:27

enemy shadows are still visible as well as other particle effects (have not tried giving myself a magic or fire boomerang yet)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:28

How about `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing`, under `backwards compat -> 2`

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:29

Trying that now.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:30

That seems to have fixed the invisible elf problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:31

that helps narrow it down

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:31

Now I am going to do yet another test and re-disable the new QR you added for death animation as a experiement

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:32

The funny thing is, the same new code runs regardless of the state of the old drawing QR
so a new issue shouldn't be caused by that
let me rebuild from clean

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:37


https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892298998487064637/buildpack.zip
@ FireSeraphim try this, either will fix everything or change nothing

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:38

Alright.
I'll let you know how it goes

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:43

It seems to play alright so far, other than the `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing` rule still being enabled. The new death animation QR is still disabled but I'm noticing an old thing where the death animation doesn't play all the way through on certain enemies (zols and bats) and the death animation is still too fast despite me setting it to a frames speed of 16.
I am going to disable the `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing` rule real quick and see how that pans out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:44

if the death compat qr is checked, the animations will be locked in speed and frames
also I just noticed another issue

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:44

that QR is currently not checked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:44

fun

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:45

disabled `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing` just now and the elf and friends are once again invisible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:52

ok, try this one now.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892302947810148392/buildpack.zip

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:06

Elf and friends are no longer invisible. You're making steps in the right direction, but custom death animations are still borked, in that it doesn't play all the way through and on some enemies it starts on a different frame (bats and gels come to mind as an example)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:07

send allegro.log

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:07

hmm, that only has zq logs
run it in zc again, make sure to watch a death animation
then send allegro.log

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:09

I just now enabled log game events and log script errors to allegro.log in my quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:09

shouldn't matter
I added debug logs
which don't care about the rules
should also show in the console if you have that open

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:11

I don't have that opened

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:11

it'll also show in allegro.log, so

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:15

I currently have the misc-death animation at a framespeed of 16 if that helps. I haven't changed that since last time

Oh

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:21

Here's the log after the debugger been enabled
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892310056178167878/allegro.log
I suspect the text near the bottom would be of interest to you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:22

nope, nothing there useful
the debugger being on won't change allegro.log
it will let you see the information printouts as it happens
which should be whenever something is doing a death animation

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:24

I don't know what you're looking for. I'm killing enemies and getting stuff like DeathAnim: (3/16), fr (5/9)
the fr 2/9 is coming from me killing keese

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:25

It should be printing once per frame of the animation
so the first is saying `(3/16) speed`
and `frame (5/9)`
for a 9-frame 16-speed sprite

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:26

fr 0/9 from killing gels (the little slimes)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:26

it should be making multiple prints per enemy
Technically, if it were working right, it should print `9*16` times per enemy

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:26

it is, but the fr numbers is remaining the same per enemy killed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:27

that... isn't right

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:27

just not got multiple fr 2/9 from killing a keese once

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:28

you should get the same fr value 16 frames in a row

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:29

I don't know what to tell you because I don't know what you're looking for.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:29

hopefully for those values to appear in allegro.log
because everything in the console should appear in the log

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:31

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:50

the death animation seems to be working for the most part. There's just a minor curious hiccup where near the end of the animation it repeats the first frame, it's appropriately slow at a speed of 16 so I'm going to dial that back down to 8 and see how that looks

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:53

oh boy. dialed it down to eight and the zol (little gels) are still playing the animation really slow.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:54

ditto for the octorocks playing the death animation slow despite me dialing the animation speed back down to eight (the keese seem to respect the animation speed variable and plays it at the expected 8 speed)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:55

it should be all or nothing

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:56

peahats seem to respect the 8 anim. speed
black and red moblins play the animation slow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:58

they should play it the same if it's set to the same sprite

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:05

I checked. They are set to the same sprite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:07

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:12

gels, octorock and moblins are still playing the animation slow. Other than that you have seemed to fix the hiccup I mentioned previously

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:14

in my test quest octoroks play it fine

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:15

What I just sent you my quest again via dm? I suspect that might be more productive

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:15

sure
With 9 frames 8 speed, that should be 72 frames, just over a second

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:22

@ FireSeraphim it seems to be working fine in your quest

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:23

Wha?
that's not what I'm seeing on my end

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:23

are you loading a fresh save file?
or one that was saved before?
....given, I don't think that should matter, but that's always the first thing I check

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:25

just now started and tested a fresh save file
still having the slow anim. from gels

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:25

Zoras and Octoroks appear to be animating properly
I frame-counted with frame-advance
the full anim is 72 frames long
which is a bit slow
but that's how you have it set up

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:27

have you killed a keese yet?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:27

oh
I just killed a tektite
so, uh
the slow animation is not the problem
that's correct
the fast one is the problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:31

oh
oh wait you motherfucker
. . . so, enemies that are in the air are drawn multiple times per frame. Which uh. Fuck.
Need to move where this logic is done

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:47

well at least it's two steps forward and one step back, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:56

so, the invisibility seems to like coming back constantly on me
but goes away when I build from clean
....fun annoyances that make it take much longer to compile, yay
<a:hugheart:884673091878391828>
hopefully this will be done soon

thanks a ton
(replying to @ FireSeraphim "the death animation seems to…"): this is how all animations work iirc with the looping
so putting a duplicate frame at the end can pretty much fix the appearance of it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 16:22

I fixed that issue

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 18:17

Sorry about that guys, I was honesty up past what I should have been
I'm in the Central Time Zone and our discussion (for me at least) was past midnight.
I'll promptly let you know how it both pans out

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 18:40

I can confirm that the animation bug is fixed on my end. With one caveat: now the octorock, gels, keese and moblins are missing their death sound while the aquamentus and dodongos aren't.
Just one last little problem

=== @ P-Tux7 09/26/2021 01:44

oh yeah i noticed years ago and reported it on the old server. this applies to getting a ring and then BEATING a quest without saving as well
it may be tricky to write it to the save file without saving the rest of the game as well

=== @ P-Tux7 09/26/2021 01:46

but wait, that's odd... isn't the game saved after winning it? i wonder what the issue is here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 15:08

no, p-tux, that's unrelated
this is a bug with the `reload_game_icons` config

## ✅🔒CSet2 issue on loading tileset? (#905)

Attempting to load DoR in the latest nightly is yielding some seriously strange results. Many combos have wonky CSet2 properties and cset offsets

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891560675233640519/891560706888044614/unknown.png)
Here's what one of the sample screens look like

Here's what one of the combos looks like in the editor

According to Russ CSet2 was set to 1 in 2.53. Now it's 15
Clicking a combo and clicking OK also changes it to 11

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 05:48

this isn't a problem I foresaw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:21

see if you can figure out a good way to handle this, Dimi....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:23

....also, why would you `vbound` and then `%12`? the modulo is supposed to be doing the bounding there, so the logic is slightly off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:25

So, it seems that the issue is of sign
because the 0-16 value range
was treated as `-8 to 7`
....so, uh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:31

something like
```cpp
if(loading_old_version)
{
    int cs = temp_combo.csets&15;
    if(cs&8) //sign bit
    {
        cs |= ~int(0xF); //bitwise shit to make it correct
        temp_combo.csets = 12+cs;
    }
}```
...won't work perfectly, but will fix most situations
it won't fix it if csets 12-15 were being used
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 's change to fix, when she's up to it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:05

....except wait, no

It's weird because it still catches it and gives the exact same warning, but doesn't auto delete if it's in a zip

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:51

great job windows

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:52

Also I can add exclusions but only at an exact path. eg, a file named zelda.exe in my downloads folder but not any file named zelda.exe
That seems like an important distinction to be able to make

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:52

yep I hate that so much
guessing it doesn't like `*/zelda.exe` as a path, huh?

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:54

That would imply being able to specifiy a path as a string, rather than with a file picker dialogue 🤔

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:54

oof
probably a string somewhere in the registry.... totally safe to edit, right?

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:54

Maybe if I hack up some registry shit it'd work, but it's not worth that level of effort

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:55

Anyway, to the issue at hand
there's a compat QR, should be enabled when loading any quest saved before *this build*
with it on, cset2 will work exactly as before

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:56

probably sound like a boomer here but this just shows how infanitilized tech is becoming.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:56

also, independently fixed the issue with negative values

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:57

I recall I used to complain about odd issues with windows usability but at least back then they could trust the user to use their own shit
And yeah, DoR appears to load properly now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:57

now do `pick ruleset: modern`
and see if anything changes
(or disable the compat rule on the last tab)

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:58

Modern ruleset doesn't appear to have changed anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:59

k, so most of the issue was the separate bug
the QR affects the wrapping of csets, so if you have `CS 11, CS2 +1` that will go to `CS 12` in old quests, but `CS 0` in new quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 08:01

Any chance you have time to test #deleted-channel ?

So something related to the gleeok taking damage I assume

To be clear, is this the kind of crash where Windows reports ZC is not responding, the kind of crash where the window closes immediately, or the kind where the screen stops updating

=== @ NightmareJames 09/26/2021 23:36

Yes

=== @ NightmareJames 09/27/2021 14:29

Reproduced the crash in another room, this time the Pols Voice room/Like Like room with Red and Blue Bubbles.  Has something to do with Red Bubble Jinxes I believe, which were also in the Gleeok room
I could recreate all three rooms in a test quest with all the current items if needed

so the weapon has a script assigned to it from the enemy data
it's just... not working

There's some stupid variable naming
And a backend refactor of some code left something checking `script` instead of `weaponscript`
... nice thing is now sprites (npc/wpn/itmspr) don't allocate script info or stack memory unless they have a script
And they all use a consistent function for script running
.... but weapons have a tiny difference for no good reason, thanks zoria.

=== @ Moosh 09/27/2021 06:58

This would work similarly to CopyTile() and similar functions, but be sourced from a ZScript bitmap. I imagine arguments would look something like:
`BitmapToTile(bitmap b, int x, int y, int dest, bool eightbit)`
It'd always copy in 16x16 sections from the source bitmap and if 8-bit is turned off, would merge the colors into one cset by index like in the editor. Hopefully the internals of CopyTile could do enough heavy lifting that the latter part isn't especially difficult. If not I wouldn't be against assuming 8-bit in all cases. But yeah, this would be handy for paper doll systems, switching out large graphics banks from external files (would probably require a loading screen) and just generally give ZScript total access to the tile page.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2021 07:21

Tile stuff uses *pointer math*, so it's always a huge headache to comprehend what *anything* is doing

All 17 of those tiles are blank at the start, and nothing ever changes what tiles are being displayed, nor is there any copytile usage.
Bitmap drawing to tiles magic
```cpp
void WriteTile( int layer, int x, int y, int tile, bool is8bit, bool mask);
 * Writes a 16x16 area from (x,y) of the bitmap at layer 'layer' 
 *     TO the tile page, overwriting the tile 'tile', either 4 or 8 bit.
 * If 'mask' is true, overlays instead of overwrites```

Splendid. And it's updating in real time too? Looks excellent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:10

Obviously it has the same restraints as CopyTile
in that it won't carry over between reloads and such

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:10

No copying to blank tiles I assume

?

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:10

Though IIRC, flagging a tile as 8-bit makes it no longer treated as blank

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:11

why would you not be able to write to blank tiles

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:12

Beats me. Been that way as long as I remember. I kinda figured it had something to do with how tiles are compressed. Though in hindsight it may just be a bug 🤣

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:12

is that an issue with CopyTile?

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/28/2021 01:51

Apologies if this has already been requested, but I was wanting to request enemy knockback as a feature.

The idea is that take a darknut for instance. Darknuts probably wouldn't realistically get knocked back by sword as like a keese.

Furthermore, with enemies drowning in water being a thing, enemy knockback could be used to make that harder.

Bonus points if you could alter the knockback the enemy experiences based on weapons.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 01:52

Scripts can access scripted knockback via new npc-> commands

=== @ P-Tux7 09/28/2021 16:02

the darknut thing isn't even scripted
you'd just set whatever npc flag determines knockback to 0 via npc script
as usual removing is easier than adding

Wouldn't be possible to have bracelets that have a noticeable effect on pushing speeds on lower tiered/leveled blocks. An example being a Lv2 Bracelet pushing a Lv0 Block at a noticeably faster speed. Partially quoting myself but I think this simple tweak might be a good idea.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 02:43

Wouldn't be level-based, would be an attribute of the bracelet item

After pressing the m hotkey to map a block on tiles to combo space, if you press escape key while on the combo page you can cancel out of mapping the combos. As soon as you select a combo position to map to however, you cannot cancel the action. The cancel button in the combo editing popup does not actually function as a cancel button.

=== @ Moosh 09/30/2021 01:10

This is really annoying if you happen to press M by accident and hastily press enter on that combo page screen. It'll map whatever you had selected to the start of the combo table, overwriting it. This cancel button worked properly in 2.53

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2021 02:33

Here's a "super serious" bug I noticed recently. If you collect a tunic and then touch the Zelda flag without saving, the game icon doesn't update to reflect your tunic color. Everything else in the quest appears to be saved though. Would it be possible to make it so the credits sequence works the same as a normal save, possibly with a quest rule in case people want to keep this behavior to verify a 0 save game?
Here's an example quest showcasing the behavior

I have no idea why the icon isn't saving, but nothing I changed worked....

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 10:40

I suspect cause it's reading the ring from zinitdata and not gamedata; I think the former might be invalid by the time the ending rolls around?

```load_game_icon(game,false,currgame);``` 
```load_game_icon(saves+currgame,false,currgame);``` Changing game to saves_currgame fixed it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:04

This was a giant pain to figure out
tiny little error in a haystack.

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 07:09

```saves+currgame```
Dare I ask what this is?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:10

oh

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:10

currgame is an int pointing to the save slot id

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:10

`saves` is an array

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:10

and saves is an array

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:10

so `saves+currgame` is the same as `&(saves[currgame])`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:11

Don't ask me *how* that works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:11

a pointer to the `currgame`th element of the array

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:11

it's black voodoo magic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:11

in this case, it's a pointer to the save file of the current quest
as opposed to the current game object
What line is this on?
I can probably explain more detail

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:12

3 different lines in ending.cpp, and the exact lines might not be the same cause I added a bit more code to debug and clean up
656?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:12

oh
is it the one in `inc_quest`?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:12

in ending()

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:13

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893241534588268574/941955102967750686/unknown.png)
That is copying `game` to `saves[currgame]`
and then calling those functions

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 07:13

That's kinda what I figured was up, but adding arbitrary offsets to a pointer scares me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:14

Adding to a pointer offsets by the added value times the number of bytes that the type of the array takes up
so a `byte[]`, doing `+ 2` is `+ 2 bytes`
an `int32_t[]`, doing `+2` is `+ 8  bytes`
because `sizeof(int32_t) == 4`
And if say, you have an `itemdata[]`, then it offsets by several hundred bytes per value added
or, for instance, `tmpscr+1` is used often
to access the pointer to `tmpscr[1]`

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 07:15

But if you go over the size of the array it'll access random memory, yeah?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:15

Yep!

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 07:15

fun

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:15

But I mean, same happens if you go over the size in the normal way

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:15

technically I odn't think it's random memory?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:15

`tmpscr[50]` is gonna be very random
but `tmpscr+50` is equally bad

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:15

It's whatever the next thing declared is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:15

It isn't necessarily random
but it very well could be

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:16

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:16

like, an example:

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:16

it's "who the fuck knows" memory

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:17


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893241534588268574/941956067431182367/unknown.png)
this is in `gamedata`
If I access `lvlitems[512]`, that's always going to give me `lvlkeys[0]`
(`MAXLEVELS` being `512`)
This is the end of gamedata
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893241534588268574/941956307475382272/unknown.png)
If I tried to access....
`bottleSlots[276]`
that would be random
`bottleSlots[274]` and `[275]` would be the two bytes that make up `portalspr`
but [276] goes past the end of the struct
so it would be whatever memory was allocated next, which could vary widely.

Bit of an odd one here, but back in 2.50 attributes 11 and 12 were in the Data 2 tab in the editor and were used by pretty much every ghost.zh script. At some point when attributes got expanded, Zoria moved them over to the new Attributes tab. This has caused a bunch of small inconveniences for users who are familiar with 2.50 or unfamiliar with 2.55, trying to follow older script setup instructions, ect. Would it be possible to restructure the UI again to have them either moved back or accessible from both tabs?
And discord lagged out and double posted the thread. 🤦 Can someone remove the duplicate?

I'd like the cross beams to have a flag where the power is a damage multiplier based on the current sword's beam power
Example:
Power: 2 = sword beam damage x2

=== @ Guinevere 10/01/2021 03:52

Like how the spin attack takes the power of the sword and multiplies it based on the "power" slot

=== @ P-Tux7 10/01/2021 03:54

might as well do peril beam while we're at it

=== @ Guinevere 10/01/2021 03:55

sure why not
would be cool
and would make peril beams more like a desparation attack than just being able to shoot beams with low life

that works
the flickering is a lil weird
but i'll take it
thank ya

peeked at the beam break effect
and saw
```cpp

}
```

misc. types in the sprite editor were kinda iffy to figure out so i never messed with them too much

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 11:48

specifically,
```cpp

    if(dead==-1) break;
    
    // draw the beam shards
    int ofs=23-dead;
    int f = frame&3;
    int type2 = o_type;
    //tile = o_tile+((frames?frames:1)*2);
    update_weapon_frame(((frames?frames:1)*2),o_tile);
    
    if(type2)
        cs = o_cset>>4;
    if ( do_animation ) 
    {
        if(type2==3 && (f&2))
            ++tile;
    }
    if(!type2 || f==0 || (type2>1 && f==3)) overtile16(dest,tile,x-2-ofs,y+playing_field_offset-2-ofs-(z+zofs),cs,0);
    
    if(!type2 || f==2 || (type2>1 && f==1)) overtile16(dest,tile,x+2+ofs,y+playing_field_offset-2-ofs-(z+zofs),cs,1);

=== @ Orithan 10/01/2021 06:35

ZC version: 2.55 Alpha 97 hotfix.

The Lens of Truth does not appear to be operating with the ``Timer`` variable correctly. If ``Timer`` is set to above zero, the game does not drain resources most of the time you activate it.
If you do use it and it does cost, it runs the cost as intended.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/01/2021 11:30

Which quest you testing it on @ Orithan ?

=== @ Orithan 10/01/2021 11:31

My own quest.
Are there quest rules or something of the sort tied to it.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/01/2021 11:47

Can you post the quest (and any applicable saves/cheat codes)?  It helps the devs immensely

Its not publicly released yet.

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/01/2021 18:16

I can confirm a similair phenomenon exist. As an experiement I tried changing the Cane of Bryna's timer value to 30 while leaving the cost at one.

frames

=== @ NightmareJames 10/06/2021 01:53

OK

=== @ NightmareJames 10/06/2021 05:50

Anything above a value of "7" (or binary 0111) is busted.  Does this mean anythng to you @EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 15:00

```cpp
if ( frame % itemsbuf[itemid].magiccosttimer == 0 ) game->change_counter(-(itemsbuf[itemid].magic), itemsbuf[itemid].cost_counter);```
`frame` appears to be an `int`, so has a range FAR larger than 7......
....also it's a global variable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 15:02

so, very odd

=== @ P-Tux7 10/01/2021 17:47

This is an idea for ways to show formerly sound-only gameplay-affecting qualities for deaf people or people who are playing without sound.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/01/2021 17:49

-Bombable Wall and Combo Tapping - Add a spark like in oracles when the combo being tapped is bombable? I don't have any particular desire on how the sprite is determined. It could either be per-sword, a hardcoded sprite after the sword beam explosions, a global sprite for all swords, or even just recycling the boomerang/arrow poof effect or the sword beam's explosion effect.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/01/2021 17:51

-Sword and Hammer Charging - This presents a few issues, because there needs to be a distinguishing between Spin Attack/Hurricane Spin and Quake Hammer/Super Quake so that the player knows whether they are at a level 1 or 2 charge. Flashing swords/hammers might be hard to define in ZQuest unless the CSets are hardcoded or we do the costly idea of adding two definable flash CSets to the swords and hammers or scrolls... and what if the user wants the 4-CSet auto-flash?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/01/2021 17:54

We could also use two levels of rumbling effects on Link or the sword/hammer while it's charged, similar to the Stone of Agony/Farore's Wind.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/01/2021 22:51

#810 would handle charging (should add the same to hammer, didn't think about that)
as for the tapping, I could add a tapping sprite to misc sprites, letting the questmaker set a sprite for it
will want to update qst.dat with a sprite filled for that, and the sword sparkle options enabled and set up, so that `File->New` has that done already
(meta) thread name was changed: 🔓Deafness Improvements
good suggestions, something to move up the list

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 16:54

ok so i think there should be a "normal" poke spark sprite for each sword and then a "special" poke spark sprite for when it pokes something bombable

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 05:48

This is a very rare issue I've run into, possibly not a bug. More than seeing it fixed, I'd like to first understand why ZC is doing this.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893736095689342988/893736193030762496/Golem.png)
So I made a set of enemy sprites in Aseprite and wanted to rip them into ZC.
ZC has having none of it and not rendering them in the right colors. So I tried ripping the palette data from the image and ZC gave me this

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893736095689342988/893736446400294922/unknown.png)
The starting row in that palette features all the colors in the image. Would normally be indicative of something being saved incorrectly
The thing is, my palette in Aseprite looks like this. Aseprite disagrees with ZC on what this image's palette is
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893736095689342988/893736833685524500/unknown.png)
And when I open it in Gimp, same result
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893736095689342988/893736946591993876/unknown.png)

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 05:53

Both programs agree that the image is indexed and only ZC is disagreeing and giving me that wacky palette. I suspect this has something to do with ZC being as old as time, could be it ignores some parts of the PNG format that more modern programs are catching
So I'd like to figure out where it's getting this palette data from and how to save it correctly in these other programs so that ZC respects it

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 05:55

For comparison, when I saved the same image as a BMP it worked fine. But that doesn't particularly surprise me

I'm actually going to second this.  I noticed palettes can be off when translating from Paint Shop Pro unless I do special things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 10:49

(replying to @ Moosh "For comparison, when I saved…"): ^ This is what I was going to suggest as a fix
I have no fucking clue why this would do this, but bitmap is the image type ZC uses, so it makes sense that that would work better

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 10:52

So at no point does ZC itself read the image headers? It's all allegro witchcraft?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 10:52

I have no idea
what menu are you doing this in, exactly?

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 10:55

Grab menu initially. Colors went all fucky so I went to investigate. Same behavior in the palette grabber

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 10:56

Now what it looks like it's done is what happens when you try to rip in a non indexed image
In which case it auto generates a palette for it

=== @ NightmareJames 10/02/2021 10:00

Balance issue, Bubbles are kinda useless in A and B quests because of the fact that you can just set weapons to whatever button and get around them.  We might need new enemies (A and B button jinxes) to counteract that.  Whether by editor or script I don't know (or care), but it needs to be addressed.  Definitely not on the priority side, but noted.  Also, potions need to be able to remove these jinxes OBVIOUSLY

You can also post this in [#zc-scripting](https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/878114935396257852) if you are okay with a script too

=== @ Guinevere 10/02/2021 22:31

i thought jinx bubbles affected the sword/item itself, not the button they use

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:32

they do
he's requesting them to affect the button

=== @ Guinevere 10/02/2021 22:34

but he said bubbles are useless for a and b quests because you can get around them by swapping items

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:34

aye
he's saying that you can just not have a sword equipped, and thus be able to use both buttons still

=== @ Guinevere 10/02/2021 22:34

ahh

=== @ Guinevere 10/02/2021 22:36

having item jinxes instead of sword jinxes also fixes that
but i can see the utility of button disabling jinxes
(might also be beneficial to have x and y jinxes as well)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 22:51

yeah i'm sure the enemy can set a status when you touch it where the status disables said buttons' usage
and vice versa for a blue button bubble
i think button disabling is in zscript right?

=== @ Guinevere 10/03/2021 00:19

ye
you could script it where if link gets jinxed, disable so-and-so buttons

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 22:16

If we're talking about GUI improvements I think it would a good and sensible idea to move under combos to the secret combos tab

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:17

This is smart

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 22:17

Ideally in the misc subtab in secret combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:17

but, it'll wait until we redesign the secret combo dialog
because, we're converting everything to a new dialog system here
so it requires a lot of rewriting of the various pieces

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 22:18

I saw your GUI discussions and I felt I ought to contribute in my own way

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 22:19

I got maybe a few more GUI improvement ideas to suggest

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 22:23

Infact maybe there should be a general gui discussion thread in new-gui-plans because I don't think the feature request category is ideal for throwing gui related idea and bouncing 'em off.
I can sorta visualize how a consolidation of the title and side warp category would like in my head

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:24

I just allowed thread creation in [#new-gui-plans](https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/888250124483059713)

=== @ NightmareJames 10/02/2021 22:43

I give my blessing to this.  Under Combos can be easily forgotten

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 10/03/2021 00:24

I wonder if this also means we'd free up a Hotkey.  F10 or F11, since it'll all be in one screen.
Then again, people use warps so often that having a hotkey that goes directly to that tab will be very helpful, rather than having to click one more time to go to another warp tab.

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) Is there any chance that the chest combo changes caused this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:33

Well, those changes are required for something like this to work at all
So almost certainly related

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:34

two tile chests tend to involve linked combos (copycats)
and this one would IMO be a maor compat issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:35

To have only half the combo be openable requires the new collision checks

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:35

might be wise for now to add a temp rule and use the old chest code for old quests until you can do a proper fix

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:35

That already exists as a compat rule
Old quests always use the old code

=== @ Orithan 10/03/2021 13:26

printf does not appear to read integer args fed into it properly, or at the very least ``weapon->OriginalTile``. It gives a completely incorrect result back.

```
Spear's original tile is set to 20621, as confirmed by Trace(spear->OriginalTile);
printf("Spear OriginalTile: %i", spear->OriginalTile);
Print result: "Spear OriginalTile: 206211.0000"
```

=== @ Orithan 10/03/2021 13:49

Tested with other numbers
Seems to consistently do it with any number, usually adding another digit to the end.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 05:04

Presumably `%d` works fine still?
Or does that also give issues

=== @ Orithan 10/04/2021 05:52

Might have to check

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:19

Is `%i` not the same case as `%d`? These are identical in C

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:19

Nope

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:19

i for integer d for decimal (versus hexadecimal)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:19

%i is intended to always be integer
While %f is float

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:20

so is %d
always iteger

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:20

%d automatically chooses %i or %f here

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:20

oh
err
that's nonstandard

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:20

If the value has a non-0 decimal portion
Aye
I believe that's how std did it
I just ported the behavior

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:20

and may break older quests?
Did it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:21

I recall following it very specifically

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:23

```else if(chr == 'i') return MF_INT;
    else if(chr == 'f') return MF_FLOAT;
    else if(chr == 'd') return MF_NUM;```
Moses..nani.
Well at least *I* didn't do that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:24

Personally, I like the option, it makes sense with ZScripts odd numbers

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:24

I would have made `i` and `d` the same.If you want `f` use `f`
I suppose
it is just bizarre when you are used to real printf.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:24

Aye, certainly
At least I added mindigits (with a rule for old printf for old script preservation)
Not having `%03d` was painful

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:26

Sure
I don't mind new stuff. You know that.
That's a useful addition.

Similar to Secrets, you should be able to collect any dropped/left items before timed warping.  I hope this would not be too hard to implement, even if it isn't a high priority list.  Basically after you pick up the last item (or it disappears) the timer starts

=== @ Orithan 10/04/2021 03:58

There are a few item classes that are not documented in ``std.zh`` yet. I'm hoping these can be documented later down the track.
These include Lanterns (``Family: 268``). Curiously that is also the family ID reserved for the Ether Medallion itemclass according to std.zh.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 07:42

Hmm Emily added it in-between instead of at the end? Not a huge issue. Ether is probably not going to happen in this version as it needs frozen enemies.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 07:44

```cpp

    /*
    itype_templast,
    itype_ether, itype_bombos, itype_quake, 
    itype_powder,
    itype_trowel,
    itype_instrument,
    itype_sword180,
    itype_sword_gb,
    itype_firerod,
    itype_scripted_001 = 400, 
    itype_scripted_002,

    itype_scripted_008,
    itype_scripted_009,
    itype_scripted_010,
    */```
these itemclasses, while reserved, were commented out internally
so I ignored them in adding more
none of these are implemented yet, so they don't need constants reserved yet. I didn't realize std_zh had them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 07:57

@ Orithan it's only lantern, right?
`IC_ATKRING = 267` is already there, so

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:12

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) You can  safelyremove the consts for `itype_templast,` and a after it in <std>
Need to bump the std metadata and version info and make a new branch for it though
You pushed your last change to headers w/o doing that (ghost)
so, I am reminding you that these things exist and for <std> it is critical to always update metadata and push as a branch then merge to master
`std_meta.zh`
Also did you add the lantern to *modues*?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:16

(The module format requires an update with any new item class so that ZQ knows how to label it in the GUI based on the module.)

What about the module data?
P.S. Module data fields are in both ZCP and ZQE

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 09:01

There is a default str literal for eachgroup and each group is sized; then the actual module loading can overwrite the field. You need to increment the number of string fields for itemclasses, add the literal, and add a loading fieldfor the.zmod

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 09:04

exactly what it's says on the tin. I have a custom Peahat 2 enemy that I made and well it's not firing it's project I set for it (I kinda expect it to fire the projectile intermittently while flying) and near the end of it's animation it flickers in and out of existance. I have gone ahead and taken screenshots of the enemy editor on my end so the devs can have an easier time replicating my edit, I've only snapshot values outside of the default for this enemy type.

oh, duh, entirely missed the part where it wasn't firing
but the flicker issue was a bug with `4-Frame Flying 8-Dir Firing` animation style

I was kinda expecting my peahat 2 to shoot it's fireball while moving and ideally on the last frame where it's all yellow.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 11:52

Peahats have no weapon firing code

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 11:53

adding such would need to be a feature request... and likely one we would not take up because enemy code is not something we really want to touch right now
Or, you could use an NPC script

I see...

npc script doFiring
{

    {
        while(true)
        {
            if(this->Tile >= this->OriginalTile + 80)
            {
                while(this->Tile >= this->OriginalTile + 80)
                    Waitframe();

            }
            Waitframe();

That should work for you
When it hits the end of the 'firing' animation, it will shoot it's set weapon

unfortunately not for 2.55
changing combos like that could break combo scripts running
and, you can use `combodata` to do this much easier

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 09:43

```cpp
combodata cd = Game->LoadComboData(ffc->Data);
Trace(cd->Type);
Trace(cd->OriginalTile);
Trace(cd->Tile);
Trace(cd->Walk);
Trace(cd->Frames);
Trace(cd->Attributes[0]);```etc etc

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 11:12

Here is a 2.55 compliant form
```c
//These are functions for reading various properties of combos used by FFCs.

//Returns Type of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboType(ffc f)
{
    cobodata cd = Game->LoadComboData(f->Data);
    return cd->Type;
}

//Returns Inherent Flag of combo used by given FFC.

//Returns Solidity Mask of combo used by given FFC.

    return cd->Walk;
}```

It doesn't need to exist though as it is literaly one line each

...
```c

int GetFFCComboType(ffc f)
{
    return Game->LoadComboData(f->Data)->Type;

//Returns Inherent Flag of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboIFlag(ffc f)

}

//Returns Solidity Mask of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboSolidity(ffc f)
{
    return Game->LoadComboData(f->Data)->Walk;

```int type = Game->LoadComboData(f->Data)->Type;```

int GetFFCComboType(ffc f, int scratchmap, int scratchscr)

    return Game->GetComboFlag(scratchmap, scratchscr, 0);
}

//Returns Inherent Flag of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboIFlag(ffc f, int scratchmap, int scratchscr)
{

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/05/2021 02:19

The idea just now occurred to me, why are still using two to four checkboxes in QR to determine the amount of triforce pieces in a quest? I believe it would be better to have as a typeable number count for triforce pieces in a manner similiar to how map count is now handled. Heck it can even be moved to the same tab that mapcount and the like now call home.

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/05/2021 02:21

It would certainly around more options in quest making, such as a quest that require 12 or even 16 triforce pieces!

=== @ Alucard648 10/05/2021 04:51

Or even multiple McGuffin sets. LttP, LbtW, Twilight Princess etc...

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 05:25

This would also go good with a Catch All in Triforce Check rooms
With an option to require all pieces up to the specified #, or only a certain amount of pieces equal to the specified #
Like a need 1st 4 triforce pieces room, or need any 4 triforce pieces room

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 05:28

Though I would accept a scripted solution

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/05/2021 23:21

Why limit it to eight and therefore lock out the possibility of having more than eight triforce pieces/macguffins?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 23:23

There are only 8 bits in init data allocated to storing those
so if I want to expand that, I actually have to expand init data
which currently would break changes Dimi is trying to make with sideview water

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/06/2021 00:00

and you wouldn't need to care about init data as you wouldn't start with anything

the script needed for this is so simple that internal handling  is super extraneous for the limited number of games that would use it imo

=== @ Moosh 10/05/2021 10:11

After writing to ABXY, upon opening the subscreen, the subscreen selector selects an invalid item position. Sometimes it's invisible sometimes it's where an item I removed via script used to be. I am selecting nothing and I must scream. This is incredibly annoying for multiple character systems where I want it to remember who had what items

Here's a quest and script file demonstrating the bug. L and R swap characters.

=== @ Moosh 10/05/2021 11:22

Also noted another oddity, in that newly added items are added to Y and X buttons before B and A. That priority seems backwards

=== @ Moosh 10/09/2021 05:38

Trying to figure this one out again, to at least be able to sidestep it, it appears when the item position goes invisible the cursor is selecting item 0. Or at least something that assigns item 0 when I put it on a button
That's item ID 0, not subscreen item position 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 08:43

I don't think the `->ItemA` `->ItemB` etc are really built to work well with the engine subscreen
they *override* your item selection

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 08:50

They've been working well after I overwrote the default subscreen entirely. But that subscreen was not playing kindly with giving and taking items from the player

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 08:52

the engine subscreen is a fucking mess
everything about it is bad

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 08:56

It's pretty cringe, yeah
Did scrolling functions for X and Y ever get added?
That always worked for selecting items pre 2.55
And if setting them directly will always have bugs with the engine default, might as well. Not everybody has the patience to reinvent the wheel sadly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 09:18

...nope, don't seem to exist
`SelectXWeapon` and `SelectYWeapon` need to be added

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:04

@ Moosh ```
void SelectAWeapon(int dir);
void SelectBWeapon(int dir);
void SelectXWeapon(int dir);
void SelectYWeapon(int dir);
    * Changes the A/B/X/Y button item (respectively), in the same manner the engine subscreen cursor
    * moves. DIR_RIGHT/DIR_LEFT are equivalent to how quickswap cycles.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 18:41

(replying to @ Moosh "Trying to figure this one out…"): It's cause of this
```Awpn = value/10000;
            game->awpn = value/10000;``` this is a simplification of what ->ItemA does
Awpn is your, well, A button weapon

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 18:43

game->awpn, on the other hand, is the subscreen position of what you're selecting

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 18:44

the problem here is getting an awpn from the A, well, weapon
cause remember, the subscreen has weird hybrid item classes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 20:20

actually, found a simple solution, even if it's not the best: cause there's a way to convert slots to a weapon type, and there's only 256 slots, so I can loop through all the slots and return the first one that matches the current weapon

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 20:21

it could be more optimized if I knew how to get the count of used subscreen items, because I doubt there's a lot of quests that use all the subscreen slots
I also put in a "if ItemX != value you're trying to set it to"
just so calling it every frame won't lag the game out like Link->Item[]

there is a flaw, in that the cursor doesn't actually save whether the last item you selected was an A button, a B Button, etc

Does it differentiate?
Like the selection cursor doesn't care what it's selecting until you press a button to assign it doesn't it?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:08

Currently, it just loops through B, A, and I forget the order of X and Y, in that order, and grabs the first one to set the cursor to when you open the subscreen

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:11

you can notice it in stuff like Isle of Rebirth in 2.50.2 or whichever where you have, say, the candle on B, and then you go to select the sword on A; since the sword was the most recent thing you selected, it really should be on the sword when you open the subscreen, but it defaults to the candle cause that's what's on your B button and B button gets priority
but that's an unrelated bug to this one; just another flaw with the subscreen I need to fix at some point

Complete the set. Even if some of the uses for this function are outdated, the functions themselves still have occasional uses. If I want to cycle items by some method except for the quest rule, there's just no convenient way to do that.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/06/2021 14:24

`SetItemSlot(int itm_id, int button, int force);` replaces al of the old stuff and is internal/fast.
```int SetItemSlot(int itm_id, int button, int force);                
 * This allows you to set Link's button items without binary operation with options for forcing them.
 * Use the constants ITM_REQUIRE_* and ITM_SLOT_* from <std> when passing values into this function.

I have programed 15 bombs you start the game with, but only 3 keep ending up in my inventory when i pick up bomb ammo.  This happens a second time when I pick up the Super bomb.  I have super bombs as their own selectable items next to normal bombs.   In the Alphas before what i had setup worked absolutely fine.   When i pick up a super bomb, my bombs are reduced back to 3 and i have to pick up the 15 bomb increase item again.   Bombs and Super Bombs share the same bag.  I think this should be undone for super bombs to have their own bag item.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/06/2021 00:29

Super bombs think they are infinite if I pick them up
And my regular bombs go down to 3
.
Because of a technical issue I switched my bombs around with Super bombs
Because the dungeons in my game use that
So Regular bombs are the super bombs
And super bombs are regular bombs.
But the stats I changed to what they are supposed to be for both.
In game
I have done this from the start of my games development
It would be impossible to undo everything on all the maps just to put bomb areas at default
But my bomb counters are not counting the bombs correctly
When I pick them up
This was not a problem until like alpha 2.55 Alpha 97 - then this started to do this
I will check them too now also

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/06/2021 08:15

been testing the newest build and I'm running into a couple of "interesting" (in the chinese sense of the word) problems. I have a magic shield and fireballs from the zora still make the correct metallic ding noise when hitting link's shield but afterwords they keep on going. I believe this problem is also connected to another one where Link can seemingly only fire swordbeams once per screen.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 14:57

*what* and *what*
fuuuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 15:38

I'd almost expect the first one to be part of the weapon unblockable flagset I added
....does that occur in A97?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/06/2021 20:03

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "been testing the newest build…"): worn-out sword

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 00:19

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) Yes. I downloaded and tested both yesterday

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 05:46

Any progress on fixing the bug I mentioned?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:11

OK, started testing
1. I can fire multiple swordbeams, so I don't seem to be able to replicate that issue
2. Zora fireballs clink against my magic shield and die
so uh
@ FireSeraphim any chance you can provide a quest where this happens?

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:17

I'm sending you the latest copy of my quest via DM. That's where it's happening for me/

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:25

So, the sword beam

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895222731581321216/895663166674067476/unknown.png)
You have it set so weapons can go offscreen thanks to that compat rule
.....so, the sword beam is never dying.
And you can't have more than one alive at once

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:26

I don't think I touched that setting. The shield thing is still disconcerting though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:27

what screen will I find a Zora on
oh
right there
ummm
the fireball dies on the shield
just as expected

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:28

Wha?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:28

oh
it's the *same QR*
causing both issues
@ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) Do you at all recall what `Weapons Can Go Out of Bounds (Offscreen)` was compat for?
because it seems to cause a number of issues
(For now @ FireSeraphim just uncheck the rule. Generally, you don't want most compat rules on if you can help it)

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:30

Aye. I think I put it on to prevent the old "hiding in the dungeon's doorways to avoid enemy projectiles" tactic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:31

Generally speaking compat rules should be off if you can help it, as usually they are just enabling old bugs
like this one you have on

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895222731581321216/895664743631704074/unknown.png)
light force magic ring doubles as magic wallet
because, it used to, for some reason, because bug
....some of them make sense to leave on, though, until you have a reason to remove them

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895222731581321216/895665074918801428/unknown.png)

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:33

To be fair thought the tileset in my quest started out as FYS and I think it had a few of those rules enabled since FYS was made in a older version of ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:33

unchecking THOSE would require adding `16` to the width/height of every string you have in the string editor
which would be tedious
so unless you have a reason that you need the bug fixed there, leaving those on is generally ok
(If you are just starting a new project I always recommend disabling them at the *start*)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:34

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) It is for scrolling engine scripts.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:34

Those are Dimi's work

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:37

but the other one is a legit compat rule added by Saf or Gleeok back around 2011/12

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:37

I'd recommend all of these be checked @ FireSeraphim
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895222731581321216/895666091555172392/unknown.png)
so it seems like `"Weapons Can Go Out of Bounds (Offscreen)"` should not be a compat rule
and also bugs the shit out of things anyway
fun times

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:38

`* Added a compatibility rule allowing weapons with collision detection disabled to move offscreen. ( Saffith, 2015-06-12 13:19:44 )`
`"Weapons Can Go Out of Bounds (Offscreen)"`
that shouldbe a weapon rule

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:39

aye, that's where I was moving it

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:39

its hould not be enabled by default

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:39

and I'm giving it `"Weapons Can Go Out of Bounds (Buggy, don't use)"` for now, considering it clearly isn't fit to be used in its' current state

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:39

it is absolutely needed for games with Z3 scrolling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:39

It shouldn't be a QR, though
it should be a flag on weapons
set by script

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:40

it changes the entire mechanic that ZC uses for weapon destruction
and it is global

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:40

it skips one switch statement
in one file
in weapons.cpp

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:41

I now whatit does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:41

it could certainly be done better as a weapon flag
so you can set each weapon to be offscreen or not

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:41

four of my games happen to rely on it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:41

aye, can't remove the rule now, it needs to stay for compat purposes
but it should never have been added as a rule in the first place

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:42

feel free to add a separate flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:42

for now, renaming the rule
`"Weapons Move Offscreen (Buggy, use at own risk)"`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:42

but I needed *all* weapons to be able to go offscreen 
 and  back into view.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:43

and moving it to `weapons` rules

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:43

it isn't buggy but it also isn't intended to be used in normal quests 🤷

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:43

Enabling the rule causes buggy behavior
and without a warning like that
we will get bug reports
like this one

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:44

must have forgotten a shieldcanblock check, as that was not intended
leave it live as a bug report, and I will loo into it in the future

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "out of curiousity what is "Ne…"): Late response, but New Water Collision changes water collision internally (honestly, it should be a compat rule instead of a combo rule), and this change I believe is required for both the new Effects square, Bridge combos, and letting you use FFCs as land, as well as some combination of the 4 quest rules that follow (I don't know off the top of my head)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 05:24

New Shallow Water Collision changes Shallow Water to use the same detection it uses to check for regular water, so you can no longer be swimming and have the shallow water graphic display under you. It's also helpful for if you want to use poisonous shallow water.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 17:49

ffcs as land? you mean you can have moving platform FFCs now?
of course the moving link with it would have to be scripted but still

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 19:50

Okay, so that behavior was... sorta implemented before
As in you can walk onto it and not start swimming
but uh, once you're already swimming you can't get off onto the ffc

Something that I panned to add is a vector of npc strings to mapscr. By using a vector it uses space only if people add strings with the caveat tat you must add them starting with npc 0 and canna sip any. Used for friendly npcs that would always spawn, so it should be fine.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/06/2021 14:47

Note that some mapscr elements already use vector storage for this reason.

Similar to npc strings a vector of items that you can reference on any mapscr. Again wen not used t will be an empty vector you you need only save a byte of the vector size in saving mapscrs ten write out the vector per mapscr if it is not empty.

=== @ Moosh 10/07/2021 08:13

Itemdata scripts have a 1 frame delay after the first frame of operation when called from an item. This delay is not present when using itemdata->RunScript().

=== @ Moosh 10/07/2021 08:14

```itemdata script Test{
    void run(){
        for(int i=0; i<10; ++i){
            Trace(i);
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
You can use this script with frame advance to see the behavior in action. On the second frame the script runs it will not print anything and then will resume printing where it left off on the third.

Here's a link to the full discussion I had with Zoria on the issue.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 09:24

Try replacing these functions with the ones in this file. It may solve it and has cleaner logic.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895584589941202964/895607345911046154/itemScriptEngine.cpp
Rearranged some more logic and added some extra sanity checks.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 09:46

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) Please try a build with this replacing `bool FFScript::itemScriptEngine()` and `bool FFScript::itemScriptEngineOnWaitdraw()` in `ffscript.cpp` and LMK if it fixes this frame No 2 bug without introducing new issues.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 09:55

Hmm, no
still skips a frame

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 09:56

Ahha
fixedlocally
change
In `zelda.cpp`, move this
```if ( !FFCore.system_suspend[susptITEMSCRIPTENGINE] )  FFCore.itemScriptEngine(); //run before lweapon scripts
    ```
under
```c
if ( !FFCore.system_suspend[susptLINK] )
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < (gofast ? 8 : 1); i++)
        {
            #if LOGGAMELOOP > 0
        al_trace("game_loop is at: %s\n", "if(Link.animate(0)\n");
        #endif
            if(Link.animate(0))
            {
            if(!Quit)
            {
                //set a B item hack
                //Bwpn = Bweapon(Bpos);
                Quit = qGAMEOVER;
            }
            
            return;
            }
            
            checklink=false;
        }
    }```
so you want this
```c
if ( !FFCore.system_suspend[susptLINK] )
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < (gofast ? 8 : 1); i++)
        {
            #if LOGGAMELOOP > 0
        al_trace("game_loop is at: %s\n", "if(Link.animate(0)\n");
        #endif
            if(Link.animate(0))
            {
            if(!Quit)
            {
                //set a B item hack
                //Bwpn = Bweapon(Bpos);
                Quit = qGAMEOVER;
            }
            
            return;
            }
            
            checklink=false;
        }
    }
    
    if ( !FFCore.system_suspend[susptITEMSCRIPTENGINE] )  FFCore.itemScriptEngine(); //run before lweapon scripts

Would this further complicate the script timings as indicated in the doc?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 10:01

I did not test all of this with passive items,but I believe that the new logicis better
IDK
passive items can be separated out into their own functions and run prior to Link which would be best
needs a new suspendtype
a compat rule to suspend both passive and active items with general item suspend and some minor rewrites
this change alone may need a compat rule'Old Itemdata Script Timing' for older 2.55 quests

=== @ Moosh 10/07/2021 10:04

Hmm...according to ZScript_Timing.txt, item action scripts should already be under Link.animate()?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 10:05

but passive items should ultimately run before Link
this only affects 2nd frame or later of active items and when passive item scripts begin
the latter is a possible problem
the first frame of an actively used item still occurs in Link.animate
this also changes the timing for when itemdata->Runscript happens including its first frame.
so that may also need to be broken off and run with passive items

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 10:09

I found the problem and documented what needs to be done
**1.** need a suspend type for passive items with a rule to link that to suspending items in general

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 10:10

**2. **need a second function pair just for passive and runscript items
placed before Link in zelda.cpp
**3.** the core `itemscriptengine`  otherwise must be after Link in zelda.cpp

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 10:13

**4.**Test the revised functions with passive stuff.
**5. **Test it all with waitdraw.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 12:50

So, what particular reason do passive items run *before* link for?
Would it not make sense to have all items run at the same time?

is his base tile and/or scripttile not set in his animastion subroutine?
Am I that far gone?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:09

ScriptTile would not be
base tile would be
so, in fact, I'd think you'd want to run the script *after* that, so it can detect his tile change, and do something based on it
i.e. `Hero->ScriptTile = Hero->Tile+20;`
that would *not* work if run before his animate

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:10

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:14

why do it in the if
and then in the else
why not just do it *before* the if
also the passive is missing a `doscript` check entirely

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:17

the passive doesn't need doscript
it's an item flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:17

. . . then what happens if the script isn't an infinite loop, and terminates?
script termination works by setting `doscript` to `0`
given, having a non-infinite-loop-passive doesn't make much *sense*

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:18

I'll go bac and loo at the original functins after I SLEEP
pretty sure that they never checked that
for that exact reason
but they can call quit
so
perhaps they did

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:19

`if ( item_doscript[q] < 1 ) continue;` is at the top of the loop in the old code
so was checked for *everything*
funnily enough, this block
```cpp
else if(item_doscript[q]==0)  //Item script ended. Clear the data, if any remains.
{
    itemScriptData[q].Clear();
    FFScript::deallocateAllArrays(SCRIPT_ITEM, q);
    itemscriptInitialised[q] = 0;
    continue;
}
```
will never run
because if doscript is 0 it does `continue;` earlier

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:20

```c
FFScript::itemScriptEngine()
{
    if ( FFCore.system_suspend[susptITEMSCRIPTENGINE] ) return false;
    //zprint("Trying to check if an %s is running.\n","item script");
    for ( int q = 0; q < MAXITEMS; q++ )
    {
        
        //zprint("Checking item ID: %d\n",q);
        if ( itemsbuf[q].script <= 0 || itemsbuf[q].script > NUMSCRIPTITEM ) continue; // > NUMSCRIPTITEM as someone could force an invaid script slot!
        
        #if DEVLEVEL > 0
        if ( runningItemScripts[q] == 3 ) //forced to run perpetually by itemdata->RunScript(int mode)
        {
            zprint("The item script is still running because it was forced by %s\n","itemdata->RunScript(true)");
            //ZScriptVersion::RunScript(SCRIPT_ITEM, itemsbuf[q].script, q & 0xFFF);
        }
        #endif
        
        //Passive items

?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:23

the function at present in 2.55 does not have a condition to end them
as they trigger on a completely differentbasis
and you can terminate them by unsetting their flag or by removing the item

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:24

```cpp
case SCRIPT_ITEM:
{
    zprint("Item script reached quit/end of scope\n");
    int new_i = 0;
    bool collect = ( ( i < 1 ) || (i == COLLECT_SCRIPT_ITEM_ZERO) );
    new_i = ( collect ) ? (( i != COLLECT_SCRIPT_ITEM_ZERO ) ? (i * -1) : 0) : i;
    
    if ( !collect )
    {
        if ( (itemsbuf[i].flags&ITEM_FLAG16) && game->item[i] ) itemsbuf[i].script = 0; //Quit perpetual scripts, too.
        item_doscript[new_i] = 0;
        for ( int q = 0; q < 1024; q++ ) item_stack[new_i][q] = 0xFFFF;
        itemScriptData[new_i].Clear();
    }
    else
    {
        item_collect_doscript[new_i] = 0;
        for ( int q = 0; q < 1024; q++ ) item_collect_stack[new_i][q] = 0xFFFF;
        itemCollectScriptData[new_i].Clear();
    }
    FFScript::deallocateAllArrays(SCRIPT_ITEM, new_i);
    zprint("Item script reached quit/end of scope for new_i: %d\n",new_i);
    itemscriptInitialised[new_i] = 0;
    
    break; //item scripts aren't gonna go again anyway
}
```
That is what would run if the script called `Quit()`
or reached end of scope
note
`item_doscript[new_i] = 0;`
and note the old passive code
```cpp
if ( (item_doscript[q] > 1) || ( (itemsbuf[q].flags&ITEM_FLAG16) && game->item[q] && (get_bit(quest_rules, qr_ITEMSCRIPTSKEEPRUNNING)) ) )
{
    //zprint("ItemScriptEngine() reached a point to call RunScript for item id: %d\n",q);
    ZScriptVersion::RunScript(SCRIPT_ITEM, itemsbuf[q].script, q&0xFFF);
    continue;

}```
which definitely checks `item_doscript`

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 10/08/2021 22:42

The big bug here is that either scrolling or warping will cause ZC to freeze for a second, and then instantly crash-to-desktop on arrival on the next screen.
------

I'll open by saying I made two additional test quests after experiencing this bug.  The second one only has two screens and two warps, which I can scroll to and warp between freely without an issue.  That was just to see if it was actual scrolling or warping that was the issue.  That test quest was made with standard NES Fixes quest fules set at first.

I also made another quest file that does the same, but with the enhanced SNES rules.  No crashes.
-------
So, this quest that crashed had me delving into the following:

1)  Opened by selecting the Enhanced SNES Rules.  Then,  I made three Dmaps.  #0 is Overworld.  #1 is a cave / Interior.  So is #3, but that has the "Wavy water effect" Dmap flag enabled because I wanted to test Sideview Swimming there.

2)  Three new Midis were added and assigned to the Dmaps.

3)  I got curious and went into the Enemy Editor and modified Enemy #123,  "NPC 1 (Standing)" and give it Goriya graphics, gave it an arrow weapon, and set its Damage and W-Damage to negative ninety in the hopes that it could heal the player. I placed that enemy as enemy #1 on the screen and put Flag #37 down somewhere.  It never spawned on-screen in-game.

4) One screen east of the upper-left corner (Where we start the quest.) I also got curious and wanted to put a Moblin, but found an enemy named "Moblin" which ended up being a Guy. So I put it in the list, but found that it was showing up as "<None>" rather than "Moblin."  In fact, all Guys show up as <None> rather than their name-sakes.  I tried to leave them in, but walking onto that screen just initiated the freeze and crash.

5) I erased those enemies because I thought they were causing the crash, and created a cave on Dmap 1 and put down some dive warps, Switch, and Switch Block combos in there along with a level-key for a lockblock in a chest combo and some enemies.

I think that's about it.  It's not a very interesting test quest.

I didn't even get to test sideview swimming, or any swimming.  It just crashes when it scrolls or warps.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 10/08/2021 22:45

It's not the Overworld Midi.  I changed it to the standard Z1 Overworld and it still crashed when scrolling East.
I'll try deleting the screen to the east and remaking it and see what happens.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 10/08/2021 22:46

**YES**.   Deleting the screen to the east and remaking it with __only__ combos and nothing else avoided the crash.
But warping into the cave on the first screen did still crash it.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 10/08/2021 22:48

Here's the test quest where it no longer crashes if you scroll to the east, but still crashes if you go into the cave on the start screen.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 10/09/2021 12:56

Neat, thanks.  I'll test it again on next release.

My concern is that the crash occurred even after I removed those NPC enemies from the screens that had them.  Even entering a cave that only had Keese and Moblins crashed after warping from a screen that had an NPC on it at one point, but was then erased from the enemies list of that screen.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 10/09/2021 22:49

I encountered a Hard Crash again.  This time, I was actually able to enter the cave on the starting screen without it crashing.

The crash occurred when I killed the blue Moblin in the first screen of the cave.  I haven't made any modifications to this test quest since I uploaded it.  This is the test quest with the deleted and remade screen to the east that didn't crash.

it crashed when you killed something
because it's the death poof
that's crashing

but not the death poof
and not even all the instances of the spawn poof

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/08/2021 23:20

This is basically for @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 
So, swimming works fine. Except that when I reach the top of the water Link gets stuck in an endless jumping animation that I can't break out of.

Also, there doesn't seem to be any gravity when swimming. Unless I am messing up on the setup.

there's new variables in init data

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/08/2021 23:28

Okay, the gravity thing is fine then. But I've adjusted the sideview leaving jump to values of 0.0025 and 1.2005, to try it out. I am able to sink back down, but he doesn't really leave the water with any jump. He gets stuck in his jumping animation briefly, then sinks down in his down animation. And at that point, every directional button makes Link go straight up.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2021 23:29

A roc's feather of `power 1` would be a jump of `3.2`, I believe?
Also, if you use a sideview ladder at the top of water, you can easily climb out

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/08/2021 23:36

Nope. I tried putting a sideview ladder at the top of the screen and had the same issue.
And I know the sideview ladder worked cause I was able to jump on it with the feather and climb up first.
Also can't jump out with the feather.

it only occurs if NoWaterHopping is disabled; which honestly is a lot more confusing of a name now that Sideview Swimming lets you actually *hop* out of the water

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 09:33

Should be fixed in the next nightly, probably coming out once I'm done fixing the other issues

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒New Nightly Sideview Swimming

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/09/2021 11:25

I was using the system built sideview ladders. I used the VD Light version to test and change everything to only be set up like a basic sideview water screen with only built in ZC functions.

Anyways, excellent. I've been waiting for sideview swimming to do a couple projects.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 11:43

so sideview ladder doesn't work exiting water from the top?
or is it only when you get into that stuck state?
if the former, does it work if you set the waterjump to 0?
and if that doesn't work, does it work if you turn on "no water hopping"?

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/09/2021 12:16

I'll have to check when I have a chance to get on the computer.

I know when I was exiting from the top he wasn't grabbing onto the ladder. But he was stuck in the water hop state. So it's very likely a water hop thing.

I'll get back to you after I try it out.
Fiance is busy doing computer things atm.

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/09/2021 12:54

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) Turning on No Water Hopping, fixed the issue. Although, I still can't jump out of the water with the Roc's Feather. Not sure if that is intended or not.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 12:54

The roc's feather isn't used to jump out of the water
you just naturally jump out of the water based on the jumping var in init data

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/09/2021 12:56

Alright. Well even then he never goes above the water's surface. You have to have a sideview ladder to get out. I just tried setting the leaving jump to 13.something, and he still won't get out.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 12:57

that's a bug

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 13:02

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:42

Pretty straightforward. Calling Game->LoadMapData() on a screen in the bottom row (0x80+) produces an error

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/896799972845056040/896799992554078249/unknown.png)

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:44

Dunno if there's some internal reason for this. Figured it might be a one line fix, otherwise no big deal
Just discovered it because I like to use that bottom row of screens for special layers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:50

This is intentional

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:50

Oh?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:51

the bottom screens *are* special, and literally don't have all the data that mapdata normally can access
so a number of things would be invalid/glitchy

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:51

Oh
Well hmm
I'ma have to test something then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:51

and, uh
in general, you should not use those screens
for anything other than their exact intended purpose

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:51

Because I think I accessed them another way
Wait nope, it checks out, it was a temp layer 🤦
How exactly are they different structurally though out of curiousity?
Wouldn't it take _more_ effort to code them to not have all the properties of a screen?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:52

frankly I don't know entirely, that's part of the ZC janky-as-fuck shit I try to avoid touching at all costs

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:53

Fair. Maybe add this as a note in the docs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:53

Also, I just checked the code

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:53

Because it sure tripped me up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:53

`0x80`/`0x81` are accessible

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:53

oh
well then
false assumption on my part I suppose

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:53

`else if ( _scr < 0 || _scr > 129 ) //0x00 to 0x81 -Z`
so, @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) , what exactly is the reason for this limitation?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:55

(replying to @ Moosh "Wait nope, it checks out, it…"): aye, temp layers are fun. Basically, there are 14 global variables that are screen objects
and it copies from the perm screen data into the global temp vars
(14 because 7 (layers 0-6) for both the current screen, and for the 'other' screen during scrolling)

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:56

Oh yeah, I believe I confirmed earlier that temp screens do not exist if the layer isn't assigned on the screen
Cause I was having difficulty debugging something and enabling the layer fixed that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:57

what happens if you access the layer?

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:57

Error I believe. Lemme double check

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:59

Oh...it's letting me read it at least. Hmm, what is up with this

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 17:00

Ah yes, it was working because I forgot to unassign the layer. Can tell I'm tired 😛

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 17:03

```        mapdata l6 = Game->LoadTempScreen(6);
        Trace(l6->ComboD[0]);```
So this works. It recognizes there's nothing there and traces 0
```            l6->ComboD[i] = Rand(100);
            l6->ComboC[i] = 0;```
This does not work. It does not successfully garble the screen
Make of that what you will
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 17:07

????
so, `l6->ComboD[i] = 10; Trace(lb->ComboD[i]);` traces `0`?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:20

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so, @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) ,…"): those are prohibitions

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:21

else if ( _scr < 0 || _scr > 129 ) //0x00 to 0x81 -Z
    {
        Z_scripterrlog("Invalid Screen ID passed to Game->LoadMapData: %d\n", _scr);
        ri->mapsref = LONG_MAX;
        return LONG_MAX;
    }

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:22

Can fix later with an inst rule

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 21:23

I was asking *why* it was limited

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:24

i wasn't sold that the 0x82 screens would be safe to modify
probably should be > 0x82

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:26

*(>130)
I missed one valid screen
0x82 is afaik never normally used
80 is guy room 81 is passageway
82 was reserved for future similar room types bu never implemented in any way

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 21:30

up to 0x87 are editable

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:37

aye  but reserved for sys expansion

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:39

so an instr rule that changes the cap rom 129 to whatever you feel *is safe considering that *would allow it if you  want

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:40

I did not want to encourage using these for random stuff
as that could limit actually adding special purposes to them

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:44

so, I intentionally limited it to screens that are at present used by engine mechanics to prevent those possible problems

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 02:41

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so, `l6->ComboD[i] = 10; Trac…"): @ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 02:42

Ah, lemme check

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 02:45

Okay so it traces whatever I set it to. So I guess the problem is less that the tempscreens don't exist and more they don't draw when the layer is unassigned

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 02:47

*OH*
`->Valid`
probably involved

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 02:51

pretty sure, aye

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 02:56

What's it change?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 02:56

I made the screen combo modify postroutine set the valid bit
so `l6->ComboD[i] = n;` should set the valid bit true

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 02:57

Ah
Will that make setting ComboD run slower?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 02:58

Technically, yes
slower by some fraction of a microsecond
so, noticably, not likely

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:00

so, does it draw the layer now?

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 03:01

Doesn't appear to, no

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 03:02

```ffc script NewLayer{
    void run(){
        mapdata l6 = Game->LoadTempScreen(6);
        for(int i=0; i<176; ++i){
            l6->ComboD[i]=Rand(100);
        }
    }
}```
Here's all I'm doing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:03

ah crap
it's checking directly against `->layermap[]`
give me a minute

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 03:10

Yup that did it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:11

changed the `->layermap[type]!=0` checks to `->valid` checks
so now once the valid bit gets set, it knows to draw the layer
viola, layer effects without needing to use up a screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:13

(replying to @ Moosh "Pretty straightforward. Calli…"): As for this original report, I'm going to call that `not a bug`. Frankly you probably shouldn't be using those screens for anything.

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 03:13

sure. I do think it should be noted in ZScript_Additions.txt though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:14

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 03:09

there are some items that have multiple sound effects tied to them. And i think it'd be neat to add more sound affects to the action tab of the item editor to make each item sound more unique from eachother.
examples:
-sword beam+peril beam+cross beam
-bomb+super bomb place
-din's fire rise+fall
- nayru's love out+in
- lens on+off
- quake+super quake pound
-spin+hurricane spin+quake+super quake charge

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/11/2021 05:46

Isn't the lens sfx set by the item edtor? Sorry i never use that item and IDR
If not shod be simple to adapt
most of these belong in a genera sfx menu

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 05:49

the point being, the lens has a separate on/off sound
and you can't just select both

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 05:50

the lens is a general sfx
but i want these to be item specific for purely for customization reasons

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 05:51

like when i shoot a sword beam from a stick
and shoot a sword beam from a sword of legendary proportions
i kinda expect them to sound different lol
just thought it would be cosmetically beneficial

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 05:54

a lot of requests i have mostly are intended to expand upon what's already there.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 08:21

well the lens one is an easy matter
have the user select one sound for on
and the sound directly after that one is used for off
i think the same can work for all the others
bombs being firstly explode then place (or vice versa)
though you could likely set a unique sound for peril beam and cross beam scrolls, no hacks needed
and i'd change the quake scrolls to be "charge then charged pound" or vice versa

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 08:26

though i have NO idea how the spin attacks or quake sounds (both charging and charged use) would interfere with the sounds that the swords and hammers themselves are set to
you could have a LTM-like additive setup but that's a lot of work and can we just use that on the rewrite please

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 14:30

My idea was to just add more slots for sound effects on the action tab for the multiple sound effects.

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 15:57

Sword: Slash Sound, Beam Sound
Peril Beam: Beam Sound
Cross Beams: Beam Sound
Din's Fire: Rise Sound, Fall Sound, Flame Sound
Nayru's Love: Fly Out Sound, Fly In Sound, Shield Sound
Lens: On Sound, Off Sound
Quake Hammer: Pound Sound, Charge Sound
Super Quake: Pound Sound, Charge Sound
Spin Attack: Spinning Sound, Charge Sound
Hurricane Spin: Spinning Sound, Charge Sound

so like 3-4 sfx slots in the action tab of the item editor

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 19:18

admittedly my idea does save quest file size since it only has one user-set value for each

what's wrong with slash?
seems to work fine for me

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 19:16

so it has four tiles
i think one of them is unused and instead a flipped version of one of the others is used

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 20:10

First tile is slash up, the second tile is slash down, the third tile is slash left, and the forth tile is slash right.
I've checked each one and all of them correlate properly.

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 20:22

Ahh. I see what's up.
you're using flipped right facing slash
yes, that one uses only 3 tiles, and flip the slash up for the slash right
with flipped right facing slash off it uses all 4 tiles

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 20:56

that means the right-down one is never used

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 20:57

only when you have flipped right facing slash on
when it's off all 4 are used

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 21:55

oh right spin attack
i wonder if it's used there

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 22:03

(i don't know what the issue is.)

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 22:06

right spin also uses the flipped down slash

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 22:09

the fourth slash sprite is there for normal gb zelda slash where it slashes up-to-right
flipped right facing slash slashes down-to-right and doesn't use the forth sprite
neither does the spin attack
they use the up facing slash slash, but they just flip it on the x-axis

A DMap setting or flag that let's you adjust whether Player autowalks 0, 1, or 2 tiles. Then a per screen flag or setting that allows you to turn auto-walk off for a specific edge

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 19:17

this could be dangerous when it comes to shutter doors since link needs to autowalk so he doesn't get stuck inside the door

=== @ vlamart 10/11/2021 19:28

Well the idea would be 2 tiles is the traditional push needed for Classic NES shutters, and 1 for free form shutters/doors, etc., and 0 for no push
## ❌🔒Scripted Fire still hurts Player despite being set otherwise. (#956)

Scripted Fire still harms the player even if the following are set:
Quest Rules, Items: ``Scripted Fire Weapons Don't Hurt Link``
Player Defenses: ``Fire or Candle Fire Player Defense = ignore``

ZC Alpha 97, Windows 10

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2021 14:10

What is the fire's `->Weapon` and `->ParentItem`? @ Orithan

=== @ Orithan 10/12/2021 14:26

``LW_FIRE``, A ``Lantern`` item

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2021 13:28

so, there's your issue
shouldn't set that to a lantern item
`Scripted ....` qrs affect items with `ParentItem < 0`
if `ParentItem > -1`, it reads flags from the item editor data
....and those flags on a lantern, are not the flags it expects from a candle

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/897407891336728637/897838706172526652/unknown.png)

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/897407891336728637/897838777853157386/unknown.png)
`Flags[2]`, `Fire Doesn't Hurt Player`
obviously the lantern is not intended to be the parent to fire weapons, so it doesn't have such a name for the flag
and the lantern could have new flags added in the future that could conflict with that
so, no bug here, just user error with wrongly modifying `ParentItem`

=== @ Orithan 10/13/2021 13:56

That's pretty annoying tbh because this is 1) poorly documented and 2) ``ParentItem`` may be used by scripters for functionality

=== @ Orithan 10/13/2021 13:58

I would like for that to be decoupled with ``ParentItem`` in the future or at the very least have a setting that sets "Do not hurt player"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2021 14:01

The purpose of ParentItem is to make an item behave as though it were generated by the given item ID

=== @ Orithan 10/13/2021 14:02

And that's the only easy way to deal with level triggers if I ever need them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2021 14:09

so
`1) poorly documented` adding documentation
`2) ParentItem may be used by scripters for functionality` Scripter error is scripter error

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2021 14:11

`I would like for that to be decoupled with ParentItem in the future or at the very least have a setting that sets "Do not hurt player" `
^This requires literally rewriting most of how weapons work
and would take months
```
int Parent;
npc Parent;
 * The ID of the item, or pointer of the npc (respectively for lweapon, and for eweapon) that created this weapon.
 * Weapons created by script have a default Parent of -1 (lweapon) and <npc>-0.0001 (eweapon). 
 * For lweapons, this value determines what item editor index to read item flags from.
 *     Setting it to an item of a class that does not normally generate the given weapon
 *     type may have unexpected effects.```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2021 14:14

(replying to @ Orithan "And that's the only easy way…"): ?
what does any of this have to do with level triggers?

=== @ Orithan 10/13/2021 14:15

Level triggers use ParentItem as a reference?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2021 14:15

oh, duh
...do they?
Or do they read `lweapon->Level`?

=== @ Orithan 10/13/2021 14:15

AFIAK

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2021 14:18

Book fire seems to burn blue, red, wand fire triggers no matter what
or wait, no, that's magic with the insta-burn book flag
the generic `wFire` code
runs
```
findentrance(x,y,mfBCANDLE,true);

if(type>1) //red candle 
{
    findentrance(x,y,mfRCANDLE,true);
}

if(linked_parent == itype_dinsfire)
{
    findentrance(x,y,mfDINSFIRE,true);
}
```
`type` here is `lweapon->Level`
(`linked_parent` is hardcoded garbage)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2021 14:21

. . . boomerangs seem to use the item editor though
what the fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2021 14:22

uhg
So, if you want better level trigger stuff, that'd be a feature request to file
`ParentItem` is not changing though, it's far too much work to change

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2021 16:02

Right now, in order to temporarily disable the shield, you have to grant a higher level shield with no block flags and then remove it appropriately.  Would be nice to have a `Hero` variable that would do this instead

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2021 16:03

This is different than flagging projectiles as unblockable - I need to do this in a lot of custom item scripts that have animations where the shield should not be active (e.g. custom slash/stab items or items with charge animations)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2021 16:18

I mean, you could remove the shield
or edit it's `itemdata`
to remove the blockflags

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2021 16:49

all of these things seem equally fussy to me
editing the itemdata most-so because incorrectly restoring them is really bad
although I guess incorrectly removing the dummy shield is also bad so maybe not worse

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/12/2021 16:50

a disable shield variable might not be hard to do
I'll look into it

I mean if it's an absolute nightmare I can definitely manage

=== @ P-Tux7 10/12/2021 18:20

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "a disable shield variable mig…"): it might be worth looking into link's invincibility code
in that state his shield reacts with nothing

the same goes for the four diagonal spin attacks using the four diagonal sprites of your current sword

oh shit
@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) the thing that saves the tile of the holdspr is saving it as long

it should be a long, because MAXTILES does not fit in word

    return readlinksprites3(f, s_version, dummy, keepdata);

`zc_custom.cpp`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 22:48

....that won't fix it though
because `flip` literally has nothing to do with it drawing or not
does `extend` have the same issue?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 22:52

If `extend` isn't `0`,`1`, or `2` it skips the drawing code

What version was it last saved in before you updated to 2.55?
....praying your answer isn't `it started in 2.55`

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/29/2021 22:55

I've been building it in 2.55 but I believe the FYS tileset I've been using started out in 2.53, so I build my quest on the quest file for the FYS tileset
so basically it's a heavily modified 2.53 quest in a nutshell.

this one? https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=tilesets&id=86

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/29/2021 22:56

yep

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 22:56

welp, that's now confusing
because loading that has no issues
So, my guess

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 22:56

Okay, so extend wasn't correct either

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 22:56

is that there *was* a bug in an older alpha
you saved in that alpha
that bug got fixed
but it stayed broken in the quest
the easy solution to this @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) is to bound the values in `linktile()`
probably not with what I did above, actually
instead, try
`if(*flip > 3) *flip = 0;`
and `if(*extend > 2) *extend = 0`
.....but that won't actually fix the values in the .qst, hmm
so you'd want to do that.... for every single sprite type on load? That seems painful

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 22:59

how about this
```cpp
void fixSprite(int32_t* arr)
{
    if(arr[spr_flip] > 3) arr[spr_flip] = 0;
    if(arr[spr_extend] > 2) arr[spr_extend] = 0;
}```
then do like this:
change
```cpp
if(keepdata)
{
    walkspr[i][spr_tile]=(int32_t)tile;
    walkspr[i][spr_flip]=(int32_t)flip;
    walkspr[i][spr_extend]=(int32_t)extend;
}
```
to
```cpp
if(keepdata)
{
    walkspr[i][spr_tile]=(int32_t)tile;
    walkspr[i][spr_flip]=(int32_t)flip;
    walkspr[i][spr_extend]=(int32_t)extend;
    fixSprite(walkspr[i]);
}
```
that should force the values within bounds for any quests that might be broken

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 23:02

and do that for every single sprite in keepdata I'm guessing?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 23:02

aye
in `readlinksprites3()`
`readlinksprites2()` should be fine, as that's only for quite old quests now (i.e. before tile page increase)
actually, how about this, even better

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 23:04

```cpp
void setSprite(int32_t* arr, int32_t tile, int32_t flip, int32_t ext)
{
    arr[spr_tile] = tile;
    arr[spr_flip] = (flip > 3 ? 0 : flip);
    arr[spr_extend] = (extend > 2 ? 0 : extend);
}```
then```cpp
if(keepdata)
{
    setSprite(walkspr[i], int32_t(tile), int32_t(flip), int32_t(extend));
}
```
simplifies the block to a function call, which will make it easier to change in the future in case of further issues

The first time the script runs, the first trace traces `0 - 30, 1`
then `1` quite a number of times
then `2`
and the combo changes
that combo cycles back into the original combo
and then the script, starting over, traces `0 - 0, 0`.
then `1` and `2` on the same frame

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/897976431634677841/897977006090772520/unknown.png)
and then `1` followed by stack errors
@ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) something is VERY broken with combodata scripts, here.

=== @ mitchfork 10/13/2021 22:48

This smells similar to some bugs I had found with combodata scripts months ago where InitD values would reset (permanently) when you left the screen and required a hard close/open
dunno if that information would help find what's going on

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/13/2021 23:57

Do you come in pieces? 🙃

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 01:34

So since this is apparently a hot mess, should I assume it's unsafe to use combo scripts on combos that can cycle at all? I have one in my quest currently and while it seems to be working fine, who knows what could be subject to change

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 02:50

A week later coming back to my question here: is it safe to use combodata scripts at all? Happening upon another situation where it would be convenient for me to use one and while it doesn't require changing back to a combo with a script, I'm worried about whatever it's doing here.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 02:52

Feel free to try it and see if it has issues
if it doesn't, good; if it does, more to report

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 02:54

Alright will do. My concern is more whether this whole situation is feasible to fix. Or is it a case of poor foresight that could potentially get deprecated

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 02:55

Oh, it'll be fixed

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 02:56

Alright cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 02:56

just a matter of taking the time to dig into fuckery

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 02:56

Yeah perfectly understandable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 02:56

things like new dialog design are much easier on the stress/mental energy
so, end up doing a lot more of that than other stuff

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 02:58

I can certainly relate to that
I've been avoiding enemy design like the plague lately
And doing every other system I possibly can first 🤣

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 02:59

I just finished `rowSpan`/`colSpan` for the new dialog system for grids
which is kinda vital for a lot of things, like for instance,
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/897976431634677841/900941523024248913/unknown.png)
To convert this (old dialog screenshot), I am gonna want the checkbox to `colSpan = 2`, since there's only one thing in that row, but 2 in every other row
(Text on the checkbox is actually *part* of the checkbox; the text on textfields/dropdowns is a separate widget)

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 03:16

```combodata script Barrel{
    void run(){
        mapdata thislayer = Game->LoadTempScreen(this->Layer());
        while(thislayer->ComboF[this->Pos]==0){
            Screen->FastTile(6, this->PosX(), this->PosY(), Link->Tile, 6, 128);
            Waitframe();
        }
        int pos = this->Pos;
        if(pos%16>0&&pos%16<15&&pos>15&&pos<160){
            thislayer->ComboD[this->Pos] = 0;
            Quit();
        }
    }
}```
Noticing another issue here which may just be the same one, when the combo sets its own ComboD to 0, the script thinks it's position is 0,0 for one frame afterwards. Tried sticking in a Quit() to fix this, but it occurs to me combodata scripts might not be able to do that by nature of how they work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 03:21

They should quit when they quit, unless writing the `ComboD` auto-quits, which frankly it should

=== @ Orithan 10/22/2021 07:33

An instance of combo scripts being ???

Might be related to this

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 08:28

Going off your description that sounds like intended behavior. Switching ComboD resets combo scripts and this is intentional. What isn't intentional is the weird corruption that happens when it tries to run a new one

=== @ Orithan 10/22/2021 09:01

The combo at the original position continues running that script if I push the combo back into place
Like its not that the script gets killed at that position, it gets suspended

=== @ Orithan 10/23/2021 05:18

A workaround to the whole "cannot cycle combo" thing can be done here:
```
Screen->FastCombo(this->Layer(), this->X, this->Y, this->ID+1, Screen->ComboC[this->Pos], OP_OPAQUE); //Draw the graphic of the next combo in the list to signify its been used, since combo cycling is not safe to do here.
```
This only works to display the next combo's graphic, so no extra functions

=== @ Orithan 10/23/2021 05:32

--==ZC CRASH==--
ZC will crash if you push a combo with another script over a combo where the first script was. The game will stop playing sound and hang for a little bit before it crashes.
Allegro\.log traced the following leading up to the crash:
```
Combodata script 2 (Dummy): Invalid ZASM command 6213 reached
Combodata script 2 (Dummy): Division by 0 Err: InvPower() exponent divisor cannot be 0!!
```

=== @ Orithan 10/23/2021 05:33

This I presume is the result of the game not clearing the first combo's script and then attempting to run a second script afterwards.
The more I think about it the more cursed combo scripts are...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 05:37

uhg why were they implemented this poorly?

=== @ Orithan 10/23/2021 05:38

Does ZC really not have a way of telling when a scripted combo does not exist on x location anymore and then clearing the script before the new combo is registered by the engine?
Because this is consistent with how moving a combo with a script appears to suspend said script until the script combo returns to the position. Hooray for janky workarounds.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 06:00

from the looks of this, @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) just completely failed to add most of the checks necessary for combo scripts to function properly

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 06:25

I didn't think about push flags. I testes the most common stuff with non-changing combos and tested writing to the grid by script. I fully anticipated there to be issues that would need beta phase resolution.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 06:26

Until recently combo scripts weren't being used by anyone and thus nested logic for these interactions wasn't being tested.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 06:28

Note that push flags are something I would always have missed as I design them using negative layers and they would always replace blank space.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 06:29

E.g., a pressure plate would be on layer -2 and the block on layer 0.
Thus, both scripts would be running.
One would never replace the other.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 06:32

IDK how I'd uncouple the script on a combo when you legitimately replace it with a push flags, or how you'd safely continue running a combo script on anything in motion.
Every script is linked to grid position and layer.
This includes its stack and its refinfo.

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2021 06:33

The script that started this whole thread was a simple "count down and then write to the grid" type, so I'm not sure what caused it to go fucky if grid writes should be cleaning everything up properly

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 06:34

Writing ComboD should stop scripts running at that pos.
If not, then either I  forgot to commit a change, I missed something, or it is a timing problem.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 06:36

IIRC I intended to make descriptions a byte array and not a flagset, to allow uncoupling states.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 06:37

*doscript

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 07:26

I think it's clearing the `doscript`, but not the `refInfo`
as it "suspended, but started back up when the combo changed back to the original combo"
that indicates to me that `pc` wasn't cleared, even though `doscript` was

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 07:28

Having a moving block run a combo script seems like it would be a separate feature to implement

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 07:29

and, I'd expect pushing a block onto a new position to end the script being run by whatever was on the position, replacing it with any script from the block

=== @ Orithan 10/23/2021 08:32

Do combos tied to FFCs inherit any of the new combo properties?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 08:46

Combo properties are tied to the combo type
so if the combo type functions on FFCs, it will have it's properties

=== @ Orithan 10/23/2021 08:48

Does it keep its script and attributes?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 09:11

combo scripts don't run on ffcs
...because, you have ffc scripts

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 09:15

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Having a moving block run a c…"): ja
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and, I'd expect pushing a blo…"): and absolutely

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 09:17

The closest to this that I tested was a  ombo script that acted as a trigger when a block on another layer was in its pos.
I never intended for moving block sprites to run their combo scripts
And I never tested what happens if a moving block overwrites a combo running a script as none of my setups ever did that.
Heck , I never do thqt
I had that in 1.9x, but not in anything after layers existed
Moving blocks need to suspend and exit any script over which they are pushed and that is its own thing that needs to occur.
The script for a block should end when you push it as its. Grid pos changes
What is happening here is that the script and its refinfo are being corrupted with lithosphere of its destination.
...
I THINK I need to disable autocorrect
*with the refinfo and stack of its destination

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 09:23

Technically if you put a script on a block it would start anew with every positional change of the block.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 09:25

The engine reads the Cambodia for script ID and if that pos had doscript&1 then it will start e exuding that script with the refinfo of any script that was already running in that pos, on that layer.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 09:26

I had never even considered giving a movingblock a script, as having designed this, I know that it would not work as the combo script engine works based on grid I'd and layer.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 09:28

I don't know a good way around simply aborting scripts with regard  to moving blocks and changing combos. You could certainly change the 0/1 to. Quad system where 2 is for a slow suspension like item scripts and 3 is for restart status.
It would take some rewrites.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 09:29

Right not the doscript is bit shifted as one byte where the shift is the layer

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 09:30

Changing it to do anything else will require a 2d byte (or 4b bitfield) array instead.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 10:51

So, I'm attempting to do several things at once here
1. I'm adding combo reset cleanup code to `modify_combo_postroutine`, so anywhere that's called will automatically handle cleaning up combo scripts
2. I'm adding specific script resetting code to `movingblock`
....and the big one, 3. Trying to add layer 1+2 pushblocks

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:10

Errr...enjoy?
I would do those one at a time, but to do as you will shall be the whole of the law.

bwahahahaha
That was way too easy

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:12

Myself, I am going to enjoy my Shabbat.
And my wine, and my far, far reduced stress levels; and play some Famicom and Atari games ere I pass out in a stinking mess.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 11:14

So, to explain what I've done here
`Quest->Options->Combos->"Pushblocks Work on Layer 1 and 2"`
when you push a pushblock on a layer, it places the undercombo specified on that layerscreen in the position on that layer (thus how these two blocks have different undercombos)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:15

Clearly one component  was easy to correct.
Oh
That wasn't related to the bug or to cdata scripts?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 11:16

If multiple blocks are in the *same position* but on *different layers*, the highest layer block will be pushed first (as if pushing it off of the stack of blocks)
I had to work with blocks anyway, and wanted to do this while I was thinking about it
Hopefully the script issues will also be fixed

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:16

Blocks on layers is trivial. I didn't add that as I was working through 400 bug reports.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 11:18

@ Moosh @ Orithan See if the combo script stuff is better in this. Also enjoy the pushblocks on layers 1+2.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:20

I put a moratorium  on new feats including shyte I would use as I wanted to solve issues ere I add any more crud to this thing. Anyway, have fun. This isn't magical and it solves nothing,but it compounds the existing  issue as this can now occur across three layers instead of only one. I strongly advise fixing the crashes and related issues ere compounding them.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 11:20

Well, hopefully I fixed the issues as well
blocks now call `FFCore.reset_combo_script(blockLayer, combopos);` when altering a combo

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:21

I hope likewise, but I suspect  that combodata scripts need more than two run conditions.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 11:21

....I didn't handle cycling, unless that calls `combo_modify_postroutine`. Gotta check that next.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:21

Same as item data they need a cool down reset frame
I NEVER fekked with cycling. I never use it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 11:22

oh, those call the postroutine
so they should be handled
```cpp
for(int32_t i=0; i<176; i++)
{
    if(newdata[i]==-1)
        continue;
        
    screen_combo_modify_preroutine(tmpscr,i);
    tmpscr->data[i]=newdata[i];
    if(newcset[i]>-1)
        tmpscr->cset[i]=newcset[i];
    screen_combo_modify_postroutine(tmpscr,i);
    
    newdata[i]=-1;
    newcset[i]=-1;
}
```

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:23

I don't create 'modern' quests. Either I am making something absurd and experimental, or I am making  a Z1 style quest, or some sort of tiny social commentary.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:24

I frankly don't recall how combo cycling works or where it lives. I have never needed to touch it and I don't personally use ite.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:25

If you recall, I don't even use animated combos for water.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:27

I never intended this feature to be used for such a comple me hanic and I'd why I added it other than DD saying we should have it.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/23/2021 11:28

I regret adding it at all.
It was on the DD todo list.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 11:35

hmm, so it *mostly* seems fixed
only one problem, Moosh's test quest ends up running the script an extra time in the frame without the variables initialized still.... but it's no longer throwing a bunch of random errors.
and, that was because it was modifying *itself*; so when it reset its' own `do_script`, it just kept running
so now, when it's combo value is changed, it exits the script
which seems to make the test quest work perfectly
...don't have a test quest for @ Orithan 's issues

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "2.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/23/2021 17:56

Whether it's actually feasible or not is another matter, but I feel like this feature is what people would *expect* out of a combo script. It's highly unfortunate how buggy and unusable combo scripts were, and even now they're still a bit jank v.v

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 21:20

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:31

You'd need to clone all the scriptdata to the sprite, then copy it to the new combo. This seems extremely unsafe to me.
To start you'll need to ensure that movingblock sprites have all of the attributes that combos have...

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:33

They will need to copy the attributes  of the combo they originally occupied and that is just one of many copies  they will need. Not will be the script stack, and the refinfo.
I have no idea how feasible that would be.
Sprite class objects and combos have  very little in common. Be sure to add this to the subcla@ of sprite::movingblock
I suppose if this works, it can be copied to lifted combos in the future.
Again, I see this as initially unsafe.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 12:36

Nothing needs to be added to movingblock

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:36

Also, -10000 as I recall is the return for invalid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 12:37

All the combo stacks, refinfos, etc for combos are global
Expanding those arrays by 1 would suffice

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:37

You would want -n where n is a special value for a movingblock

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 12:37

Aye, if -1 is the error, then -2 or some other value should be used

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:38

Those need to be copied to the sprite, so that the sprite can run them instead during its frames of movement.
And PosX and PosY would return  MovingBlock x/y
Pos() would return a special value
Otherwise a number of facets would conceptually  break.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:42

And iirc you can have more than one movingblock at a time. If I am mistaken, someone in the future may want to add that, and then you'd be back to this.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:44

Copying the data to the sprite, and then copying it to the final rest pos at the end of the block slide, is probably  the only safe and future proof way for this and will ensure that the script runs during the movingblock animation.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 12:45

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "Those need to be copied to th…"): I see no reason to copy it to the sprite, when the sprite is effectively a singleton (one instance only)
expanding the global arrays `combo_stack[]`, `combo_refinfo[]` etc by 1 index would accomplish the same

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:47

🤷
Except that would always use memory

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 12:48

the movingblock is also always in memory
`movingblock mblock2;` is a global singleton

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:49

And if it is part of the movingblock subclass it only does when those exist, and it is tied to sprite instances...wait...why?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 12:49

always in memory, regardless of if a block is moving or not

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:49

Gob

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 12:49

It quite literally just has one block in memory, and updates it's values as needed
Not very sensical, but, uh, yeah

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:50

I suppose it is leftover from v0.x
I feel as if script timing might break though if the script isn't transferred.
How should I know. I never conceptualised  needing this so I never planned it out.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:53

I never thought of a good reason why a movingblock engine sprite would need to run a script.
I could see the block triggers needing them, but not the block itself.
In fact, I tested *that*
But not on layer 0
As I knew in advance that the block would overwrite but I expected I to overwrite with script==0
Thus, it should simply kill the script. This is a case that I never even considered.
IDK if this affects armos/chest crud.
It could, I suppose if a chest appears or certain combo changes due to secrets appear or armos are triggered

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 12:59

I likewise, until now, didn't in any way anticipate these special purpose combo types/flags to already be running scripts.
This is a lack of foresight due to instinctively knowing how the engine works and never considering these invalid uses.
I have no doubts that other oversights like this exist

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2021 14:26

Tried writing a similar script as before. Everything seems to work better now, though InitD[0] appears to still bug out and reset to 0
```combodata script LessDumbCycle{
    void run(int delay, int offset){
        int sfx = this->Attribytes[0];
        Waitframes(delay);
        if(sfx>0)
            Game->PlaySound(sfx);
        mapdata lyr = Game->LoadTempScreen(this->Layer);
        lyr->ComboD[this->Pos] += offset;
    }
}```
Example script where it bugs out
```combodata script LessDumbCycle{
    void run(){
        int sfx = this->Attribytes[0];
        int delay = this->Attrishorts[0];
        int offset = this->Attributes[0];
        Trace(delay);
        Trace(offset);
        Waitframes(delay);
        if(sfx>0)
            Game->PlaySound(sfx);
        mapdata lyr = Game->LoadTempScreen(this->Layer);
        lyr->ComboD[this->Pos] += offset;
    }
}```
And then my fixed one where I didn't use InitD

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2021 14:28

Unsure if it's just InitD[0] or if there's further issues. InitD[1] seemed to be working fine when I traced it. Alternating between -1 and 1 in this case
Also small ui thing I just noticed

okay, so
it's getting initialized correctly
the problem is that it's getting overwritten
```default:
        {
            if(arg >= D(0) && arg <= D(7))            ri->d[arg - D(0)] = value;
            else if(arg >= A(0) && arg <= A(1))        ri->a[arg - A(0)] = value;
            else if(arg >= GD(0) && arg <= GD(MAX_SCRIPT_REGISTERS))    game->global_d[arg-GD(0)] = value;
            
            break;

Compare an ffc script with 2 params with a combo script with 2 params, where both scripts just `Trace();` each param

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 09:27

the first thing fixed the problem, so at least that appears to be the issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 09:27

makes perfect sense
what's happening is
it changes the combo
clears all the data
that clears `ri->pc` to 0, as well

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 09:28

and then adds one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 09:28

....but then it was adding 1

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 09:28

so it's offset
and thus reading the wrong thing off the stack

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 09:28

so it was skipping the first ZASM command

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 09:28

big oooof

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 09:28

which, is always a push
missing a push offsets the stack
and, it's the first initd
as soon as I realized it was clearing everything properly on changing the combo
I realized "wait, but this doesn't have the same auto-script-kill thing that things like `npc->Remove()` have, does it?"
it actually clearly did, but not quite in the right place.

I don't use combo scripts a lot, turns out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 09:43

I have a more robust fix
now when it clears the combo data, it sets a global var to the combo position modified (including layer info)
(`pos+176*lyr`)
then, the check compares that against the `i` value of run_script (which should be the same value for the correct combo script)
so, if that position is modified at all, it clears and exits.

Tried using combo scripts again in the latest, this still seems to be bugged.
In this case I had a bush combo with InitD of 0, I slash it to turn it into a bush combo with InitD of 1. Both are using the same bush. Second one is behaving as if InitD is still 0. Which is the same bug that was happening before IIRC

I assume combo scripts are set up in such a way that the code for restarting them when the combo changes is copied across several different combo types?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2022 10:33

It has to call a function when it changes a combo
and the slashable set of combos (`check_slash_block2()`) is missing the calls

How about step->next?
Or some obscure stuff like block holes?
Possibly generic because that can also have ->next behavior

So, every frame when combo scripts run
cache the combo id
if none was cached already
compare it to the previous cached value, and if it changed, clear the combo script data for that position, and update the cached value

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:32

Clicking out of the window or hitting the buttons to the right of the text box reverts the value back to positive if it's less than 1

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:34

in your build, if you backspace everything out of the field and then press `-`, does a `-` sign appear in the textfield?

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:34

Yes it does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:35

then you have that other issue fixed, this is separate, fun
give me a minute
....oh
I already see it
how am I that dumb?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:37

```cpp
v = atoi(tempstr);
v *= 10000;
if(v < 0)
    v -= atoi(ptr);
else v += atoi(ptr);```
spot the obvious logical flaw
so, now, ```cpp
v = atoi(tempstr);
v *= 10000;
if(tempstr[0] == '-')
    v -= atoi(ptr);
else v += atoi(ptr);```a bit smarter
just waiting for it to build
Also need you to test script access for `int Attrishorts[8];`
if you can

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:38

joy
The other combo script issue isn't getting fixed any time soon I assume? I'm kinda on a tight schedule, quest contest and all
Not to rush you guys or anything. Just saying if I can't test all these bugs, yeah there's reasons

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:40

I did the attrishorts earlier, before looking at that, just didn't take the time to build it

lemme double check to make sure I didn't do a dumb

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:48

yeah it's still the same
Ah. But it fixed it on the hex button specifically

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:49

oh fek
I see
I fixed the read from the string to the value
but not the write from the value to a string
...and fun fact, `sprintf()`'s `%X` arg doesn't handle negative values at all.
So the hex mode already has special handling for negatives

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:50

Neat
Another small detail in this dialog
When I have a decimal place selected and type another number in, it doesn't take kindly to that

Here's how 2.53 handled it
Mistakenly thought it shaved off the last decimal place

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:53

oh of course
because 2.53 literally uses a plaintext field, for the record
just with a numeric/`-`/`.` character filter
it has no idea what value is stored inside it
until the dialog closes entirely
the new system constantly stores the value, every single time you type a character

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:54

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:54

so that it can update when you click the button
oh wow that doesn't even have a numeric filter
that's extra fun

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:54

it's pretty great

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:54

it just runs the string through `atoi`

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:54

It at least recognizes not to read these as garbage data

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:54

or, well, if it detects any `.` in the string, it uses a special version
aye
that's what `atoi` does
it reads the value as an integer
and when it hits an invalid character, it instantly just stops
so if the first character is invalid, it just returns `0`
I have an idea on how to handle that slightly better
(do the attrishorts work, btw?)

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:56

Haven't tested. Actually gotta get back into dungeon design now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 03:02

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2021 11:31

ah crap
something's broken in the actual string parsing function

=== @ Moosh 12/27/2021 11:32

Ah, is that it?
I figured both tabs were using different settings for text fields
Because the first tab lets you type anything while the script one is restricted to numbers only

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2021 11:33

the base parsing function for strings is shared
the difference is the second tab has fancy fields that restrict the input

=== @ Moosh 12/27/2021 11:34

I see. So that input restriction was unrelated to the string parsing fix?

The proc for Screen->Enemies need a new tab with ten choose buttons that select a string n the string editor each aired with a numerical edit field to match the string ID (display or manual entry).

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/15/2021 03:32

Editing this would write to MapScr[n]->npcstrings[i].

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/15/2021 03:33

The data has been allocated for years and is designed to be integrated with 'friendly' enemy types to allow talking to them. (They would display the string allocated to their load slot on correct interaction.)

There are three arrays or up to ten extra specal items on mapscreens. One contains the item ID (should t to -1) and the other two are or x and y coods. The latter two should both nit to -32767
Even if there is no engine implementation this is very useful for scripts such as extra chests, &c.

**General Plan Outline**

Add immortal flag to lwpns. (Ewpns can wait)
Add ZS lwpn->Immortal to set this flag.
Add a check for the immortal flag to wpn deletion (see my QR for not deleting offscreen wpns), *except*, if a wpn is > 32768, or < -32768 on x/y and the QR is not enabled, then just toggle immortal=false.
Add a wrapper to all actions that set wDead as if(!immortal) deadstate  = wDead

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2021 20:23

If it would be to match `npc->Immortal`, the immortal state should prevent screen edge death as well

Oh yeah, how'd I forget. The fire enemy (guarding Zelda) in BS Zelda is also 6 frames.

I made these tiles for Cambria as BS-style fire tiles, but they can easily be used in the default tileset as the "New Enemy Tiles" for the Fire enemy and Guy (and Guy Fire, if that ever gets implemented as a Misc. Sprite) to demonstrate these new kind of animation styles if they get added. 6 frames on top, 8 frames on bottom.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/18/2021 17:57

Inspired by @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 's new QR to make sideview swimming only let the player face left and right. This is the same thing but for sideview. The one exception would be if the player is using a sideview ladder, where the up and down directions would be allowed, and only up would be allowed if the "Force Player to Face Up on Sideview Ladders" QR is checked. I presume the up and down directions would be allowed in the cases of Ladders and Rafts as well, as well as the Spin Attack/Hurricane spin.
This was inspired by TheRock's Mario quest.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/18/2021 22:12

Wouldnt be hard to do

=== @ P-Tux7 10/20/2021 02:26

@ Architect Abdiel does this sound good to you

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/20/2021 17:55

I don't really understand.
Wait. I think I get it. So the QR would just be for sideview in addition to sideview swimming.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/20/2021 19:44

Yeah
This also means that you can make Gohmas that need you to be on a sideview ladder or the item Ladder to shoot them
You can also use Boomerangs in new ways, since they're one of the only weapons you can aim up, down, or diagonal while facing left or right.
To hit crystal switches, combo flag switches, break customized bush combos, or kill enemies
This also applies to all other items while you are on a sideview ladder or item Ladder, such as only being able to shoot the arrows or wand up and down to hit the above mentioned things while on one of those ladders. There's a lot of puzzle potential there

=== @ P-Tux7 10/20/2021 19:48

Or using the hookshot up/down while on a ladder, or using the hammer up/down while on a ladder...

=== @ P-Tux7 10/20/2021 19:49

(Don't forget the many newly hookshottable things - bush combos, pushblocks, magic sponges/prisms, hammer pegs, treasure chests...)
Oh yeah and you can make signposts/npcs and treasure chests openable from the left/right as well. So you can have truly sideview chests like Mario 3.
(Or use the downwards-facing ones in a puzzle, hahaha...)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/20/2021 19:51

That's right, if this rule gets added you can be that evil all without scripting.

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/20/2021 21:03

I like it.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/05/2021 01:20

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ... was this added yet? We need to do some testing in the sideview engine regarding Castlevania stairs, since IIRC they used up/down

You get to Level 1, I put in now completely non-teleporting  teleporting Wizzrobes with the Red Wizzrobes on Form 1, message plays before.  You go to the Blue Gohma, Form 2.

This might have been broken this whole time; it was accessing random memory and presumably the reason it was never caught was cause shopkeepers couldn't be spawned in engine probably
either that, or the random memory pointed elsewhere

=== @ Moosh 10/19/2021 02:08

Secrets->Item doesn't trigger on a screen with Hit All Triggers->Perm Secret until you leave the screen and re-enter. Inconsequential to me, but may affect other's design.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/19/2021 02:16

Guessing `Screen->SecretsTriggered()` is also returning false in that circumstance?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/12/2021 10:14

interested here too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:06

so, actually, I feel like I understand the issue here
I'm guessing if you place a bomb/burn/arrow/etc flag, it also won't trigger those?
and that it would only trigger flags `16-31`?

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:17

Sorry for late response. Been a while since the screen where I ran into this issue. In my case it was a group of torches with flags 4/95. No 16-31 on the screen though I believe I tested with that flag both on and off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:18

Err, my point was, try placing a bomb flag somewhere in the screen
And it won't trigger from all torches being lit
Is my theory

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:19

Yeah that is the idea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:19

So, it also doesn't trigger secrets->item
As screen secrets are not triggered
Just 16-31 are triggered

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:19

But there's a flag for that
And on reentering the screen the item did drop

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:20

Because it set perm secrets
So on re- entering, all secrets trigger

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:20

And this isn't a bug?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:20

technically intended behavior, since it only triggers 16-31

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:21

I think something's not coming across here but gotta eat dinner. bbl

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:21


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/899841391042134116/909583843168755774/unknown.png)
is this flagged or not?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:25

oh
yeah
fucking wow
`fTRIGGERFPERM` sets perm secrets
but *not temp secrets*
`fTRIGGERF1631` changes flags 16 through 31 to their secret combos
but does not trigger *any* type of "secrets"
it manually replaces flag 16-31 spaces
so, neither of these triggers "temp secrets"
thus nothing calls down the item
this seems mostly intentional, based on the design of these flags
....changing the `->Perm Secret` one to also trigger temp secrets, and adding a compat rule for the old behavior, would probably be smart though.

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:45

Aha I see
It seems to me like ->Perm Secret should set the temp secret as well, especially if it does so immediately upon reentering the screen already
because that's the main thing that makes the behavior seem buggy. That it's behaving differently when the secret is triggered vs. when the screen is entered

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:46

it's "technically intentional"
but the idea that anything that doesn't trigger the screen's full temp secrets should set the perm secret flag is flawed inherently

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:47

mhm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:47

....the same issue existed with `Enemies->Secret` being permanent until a recent QR addition
as, did you know Enemies->Secret only triggered 16-31, and nothing else?

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:48

Secrets system kinda sounds like a mess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:48

## ✅🔒Crash on blitting missized bitmap (#974)
@ Moosh opened this issue on 10/20/2021

Status: fixed

Labels: ['bug']

Source: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/900339313936580628



=== @ Moosh 10/20/2021 11:07

I don't know what the exact cause of this was, but I've had crashes with this code block
```            int w = 16-activeFrames/2;
            int h = 32-activeFrames;
            int x = this->X+(16-w)/2;
            int y = this->Y-16+(32-h)/2;
            b->ReplaceColors(0, c, 0x91, 0x97);
            b->Blit(2, RT_SCREEN, 0, 0, 16, 32, x, y, w, h, 0, 0, 0, mode, 0, true);
            
            ++activeFrames;
            if(this->DeadState==1||activeFrames>16){
                TempBMP[bitid]->Create(0, 1, 1);
                this->DeadState = 1;
                Quit();
            }```
The particular problem seems to have been the `TempBMP[bitid]->Create(0, 1, 1);` after the blit (b and TempBMP[bitid] are the same bitmap in this case)

=== @ Moosh 10/20/2021 11:09

So changing the draw layer for Create() to 2, fixed it. My assumption here is that when I resize the bitmap (to flag it as freed for my temp bitmap system), it performed that operation before Blit() because of layer order and this lead to it trying to draw a bitmap smaller than I intended.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/20/2021 20:34

Aye, that's a script error. Shouldn't cause a crash, though...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:08

@ Moosh I can't replicate a crash in similar circumstances
can you provide a test quest where the crash occurs?

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:11

oh geez, I've so long since fixed the crash I don't know if I still have the full script that did it

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:12

I was sure it was specifically those two lines. It may also be to do with my temp bitmap global script, so I can try linking you that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:13

All I need is a way to make the crash occur
because if it crashes while linked to the debugger, it tells me the exact line that caused the crash

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:14

yeah I figured as much. And I figured just something along the lines of those two lines would do it because I'd narrowed down the cause to just that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:14


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/900339313936580628/901232023312670731/unknown.png)
I tried this, and a bunch of tweaking it totry to get it to crash
but it just doesn't

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:20

Only real differences I can think with my setup is the bitmap is very small (16x32) and the scale can sometimes be non integer. Can't see why that would crash though.
I'll try and see if I can reproduce it myself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:22

The scale there should be non-integer
and changing it to `1x1` should be enough, if that actually has anything to do with it

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:22

oh also it was running off a weapon script. Once again shouldn't have any impact on the timing or scale of the bitmap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:22

I'm just baffled that this is this elusive
I figured it'd be a quick fix

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:22

Yeah it seemed incredibly straightforward
I guess if it's rare that's a good thing

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:31

```global script Crashy{
    void run(){
        bitmap b = Game->AllocateBitmap();
        b->Create(0, 16, 32);
        
        while(true){
            b->Create(0, 16, 32);
            for(int i=0; i<32; ++i){
                b->Clear(0);
                b->FastTile(0, 0, 16, Link->Tile, 6, 128);
                b->ReplaceColors(0, 0x81, 0x61, 0x6F);
                b->Blit(2, RT_SCREEN, 0, 0, 16, 32, Link->X+32, Link->Y-16, i/2, i, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, true);
                if(i==31)
                    b->Create(0, 1, 1);
                    
                Waitframe();
            }
        }
    }
}```
Okay does this one crash for you?

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:32

better yet here's just the test quest I used

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:40

that crashes, perfect. Now for debug mode.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:42

well, it seems to be... where I would likely have expected, in general. Which makes me confused why mine *didn't* crash.

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:44

glad it wasn't some convoluted combination of my global systems at least

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 00:41

See, I thought Allegro was supposed to handle this for us, frankly, based on how everything was coded
and what I think is happening
....hopefully what I just attempted will fix it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 00:46

ah, it has
now it's just looping the animation repeatedly, never crashing
given, it's still an error on the script side, as the last frame it's drawing `1x1` instead of `16x32`
but, no more crashy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 00:50

building a release build now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 00:59

So, what I had to do to fix this
is, if `sx + sw > sourceBitmap->w || sy + sh > sourceBitmap->h`
it now creates a new bitmap that is `sw x sh` sized
clears that to `0`, and draws what is in-bounds from `sourceBitmap` to this new bitmap
then uses that for the draw
(so, anything "out of bounds" will read as "0", instead of reading as "crash everything")

## Adding Item Property to Whistle to disable sword jinxes (#975)

=== @ NightmareJames 10/20/2021 13:58

Another Z1 compatibility issue, put a flag in the Whistle if you play it, it removes temporary sword jinxes.  I can make LoZ videos to verify this

=== @ NightmareJames 10/20/2021 13:59

Not by any means a big priority, but would be nice.  Just putting it out there

=== @ P-Tux7 10/20/2021 15:45

so the way it worked in z1 was that playing the whistle didn't stop the countdown for the temporary jinx
so its not that the whistle was coded to remove the jinx, the jinx timer just expires on its own due to the length of the whistle song

=== @ NightmareJames 10/20/2021 16:14

OFC, but in ZC I think it'd have to be coded that way to be effective, not sure though.  Can @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)  or @EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV)  confirm?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 17:57

This is not a property of Z1. It is an artefact of the whistle tune taking longer to play than the jinx timer and should  not be part of the engine.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 17:59

thiis 'bug' in NES Z1 is literally caused by the recorder tune taking as long to play (or longer) thN the jinx clk. It is not intended and as long as you use the Z1 recorder melody it should still work in ZC. Otherwise, it can be solved with a one instr itemdata script.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/24/2021 18:10

it doesn't work in zc since iirc the temp. jinx timer is paused while the whistle plays, unlike z1

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/24/2021 20:44

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "it doesn't work in zc since i…"): I don't think this would be a hard thing to fix
under NES compat rules

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 22:58

It wouldn't be hard to fix with a script, either, as Zoria said
```cpp
itemdata script whistle
{
    void run()
    {
        if(Hero->ItemJinx > 0) Hero->ItemJinx = 0;
        if(Hero->SwordJinx > 0) Hero->SwordJinx = 0;
    }
}```

=== @ NightmareJames 10/24/2021 23:36

You sure that will work @EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) ?
If it is I'll try it out tomorrow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 23:39

....use  item, clear jinx. Very extremely basic script.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/24/2021 23:40

OK, give it a run tomorrow
Let you know how it works

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/24/2021 23:43

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "It wouldn't be hard to fix wi…"): Well, no. What I mean is letting the jinx counter count down while the whistle is being played
AKA the original behavior

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 23:43

Well, this gives the same effect with a basic script

=== @ NightmareJames 10/24/2021 23:45

Doesn't really matter.  As long as the behavior is fixed and the option is available, possibly in std.zh
We can argue that point later
I'm not going to argue semantics, I'm not difficult to work with
Thank you.  🙂

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/24/2021 23:49

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Well, this gives the same eff…"): Yeah, which is good for what NJ wants
It wouldn't change it for longer whistle tunes, but honestly I'm not sure how many people give a shit

=== @ NightmareJames 10/24/2021 23:51

Neither do I, just put it in std.zh for accuracy since it's in the original game IMO.  Quest creators can decide

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 23:56

scripts do not go in `std.zh`
they go in the `scripts` folder, separately
having any scripts in std.zh is a *terrible* idea, as that literally FORCES *EVERYONE* to have the script in their script list, at all times.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/24/2021 23:59

Agreed
Anyway, thank you

=== @ NightmareJames 10/25/2021 07:00

Before I go implementing this
Will it leave perm jinxes alone?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2021 07:23

should
that's why it checks `>0` instead of `!=0`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/25/2021 08:45

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "having any scripts in std.zh…"): Classic.zh exists for simple system extension scripts for Z1/Classic Plus quests.

I didn't contribute the dungeons of 4th, so this wouldn't affect anything on my end. For the sake of compatibility, this makes sense for the nth quests. Kinda surprised it wasn't noticed until recently (though why would one Whistle while temp jinxed?) Only use case is if a screen contained temp bubbles and a Digdogger.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/25/2021 15:33

I used it in speedruns @ HeroOfFireZC
Before the glitches changed things
It was just almost impossible to implement for a while universally

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 10/25/2021 15:42

Thinking about it more, I suppose having the jinx run out while everything is paused would be useful for normal combat. That said, this script assumes the jinx won't last longer than the length of the Whistle SFX.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 10/25/2021 15:44

For example, this would not make sense in Moosh's 7th, where he sets the SFX to basically "null", and has a script play the SFX (thus making the Whistle appear to no longer pause anything)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/27/2021 11:17

There is an engine way to do this, but also a script rendition if the a ility to read sfx length is implemented,  as planned.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/27/2021 11:19

The only true issue here is Z1 compat/,emul, qnd nonstandard sfx for Z1 emulation are not su]opted at present.
For now, the issue is solved where it matters.
Heck
I wrote a script for this two years ago. IdK why it has now become so critical.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/31/2021 19:26

3rd Quest is undergoing Whistle Testing.  Currently grinding out Rupees for the Arrow.  Going to work

=== @ NightmareJames 10/31/2021 23:36

3rd Quest Whistle Testing confirm has to wait a bit more.  Whistle doesn't look like it's in Lv. 3 and I'm short supplies

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/01/2021 00:38

Yeah, even when I knew where everything was (thanks to an unpassworded version), I still quit before the Whistle in 4.
Better than my first attempt which ended in 2 with basically nothing but the Book.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/01/2021 00:40

i like how they knew how useless the book was
let me guess it wasn't even used to trigger something you couldn't reach with the normal candle

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/01/2021 00:41

Nope, it was just "haha, you get nothing helpful in Level 1"

=== @ P-Tux7 11/01/2021 00:41

(in z1 hacking/zc 1.90 you can do this by putting a tree by the edge of the screen, then putting a tree two combos in front of it so that only magic can hit it, not the candle fire. you need to leave one space in front and a path to that space so link may walk to it once it's burnt of course)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/01/2021 00:42

I'm trying to recall if you could make Slash a required upgrade in older quests.
I think there was a specific angle for Sword flags.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/01/2021 00:42

sort of in a t-shape with burnable tree on the left, non-burnable on the right, and the path in the middle
most probably you could do that yeah
required sword flag
put it in a diagonal that only the slash could reach

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/01/2021 00:43

I think it only works if it is diagonally below where you can walk.
Due to the half tile upward walking.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/01/2021 00:44

oh true
though you could fix that by making the combo where link stands solid on the top half
so he can't be horizontally level to the sword flag

=== @ NightmareJames 11/01/2021 00:52

OK people, here's your Whistle-fixed 3rd Quest

Quests have been pinned for everyone's convenience, especially @ HeroOfFireZC , @EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) , and @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) .  They work in the latest nightly for 2.55

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 09:06

@ bigjoe , when you add this (and fix anything else you wish) with your 5th Quest, please post it here so it can be added, unless you want me to install it.  Let me know.  Thank you.

=== @ bigjoe 11/02/2021 09:10

I do not have the password to the completed and packaged version. It was changed prior to release, with I suspect good reason. Someone with master access or whatever will have to change it.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 09:12

Another replay (and a long one) in my book

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 09:15

DM me plz

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 13:12

@ Mitsukara @ Lunaria If the Discord closes for the 6th closes before you get it, you can find the Whistle fix here in the pinned section, if you choose to use it at all.  You may leave the thread after you pick it up and/or decide not to use it

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 13:46

(the "fix" fyi is that playing the whistle times out temporary jinxes like Z1)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 07:23

@ NightmareJames  I am curious if you had any permission to release modified 3rd, 4th and 5th quests, or if we have we determined that they are AGN property?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 07:25

I don't particularly care what you do here, but you were very touchy about making any bugfixes or alterations to quests > and I am interested to know what has changed or if these are unofficial homebrew hacks.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:12

Talk to @ HeroOfFireZC about the 4th or @ bigjoe about the 5th.  3rd's status is still undetermined

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:14

The current plan is to implement the fixes and to retire it as-is, but is subject to change if Alpha comes back as he has granted permission officially to edit U3Q

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:17

My stance still hasn't changed:. The original authors retain control and can only be overridden by council/community vote

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:18

I do  not o je t to the changes. Ai question if we have the right to introduce them.@ NightmareJames

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:19

5th,fine, we have contacted. 3rd and 4th, I have no clue. The original agn topics are broken.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:20

4th we are considering redoing.  You can contact @ HeroOfFireZC and it's up to him if he will allow you access

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:20

4if atn owns them, l is well. If not, then we have legal issues a d need to avoid them
I do not know the best option now  any more than I did when fixing Dodington two or three years ago

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:21

If @<role: War Lord> has any objection he can voice them here
Otherwise, the original owners retain control

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:22

Do we expect ownership and do whatever we want, or respect original content creators and do nothing until we have approval?
It is not a simple decision

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:22

The latter.  According to ZCO's charter, we have to get community approval to override

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:23

Wtf does HeroOfFire have to do with 4th ownership?
Zco?
I am getting too old for this.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:24

1.  HeroOfFire was one of the original creators of the 4th and the only one active
2.  ZCO = Zelda Classic Organization, our group's official name

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:25

He is not listed as the creator of that asset in my records. I THOUGHT IT WAS alphadawg
Or was that 3rd?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:25

AlphaDawg did the 3rd
HeroOfFireZC and QuestWizard did the 4th

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:25

Ah, well
Then he can direct 4th
I said I was going senile

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:26

I wish AlphaDawg was still involved:  Sadly, it's all I can do all things considered

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:27

I said that two years ago but you sort of ignored my deterioration and just patted me on me back...

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:28

When I repeatedly frak up, mix up events or ppl, just saying go on old man may not have been the best idea.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:29

I just don't know what to do about the 3rd's final fate personally
I don't think it should be lost permanently

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:30

Nor do I. I personally would leave it alone until ownership is conclusive and focus instead of. A new assets and qst set
I paid for the assets
I will ruthlessly go after them while I live
If I drop dead I cease caring and you all can go after them

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:31

I think you're right on this one.  Just put the two fixes in and call it a day, post it as final
And put it in the ZC.com/Pure archive and let it live in infamy

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:32

Until that time, th3y are legally my assets and I intend them to be released under a spcific licence
Android kb
And large hands

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:33

I'm just sorry I couldn't find AlphaDawg:  We did everything to hunt him down

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:34

Nobody asked me to find him
Not sure if I could do better

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:34

All his old sites and e-mails besides his tutorial are pretty much defunct

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:35

But nobody asked the defcon maniac
Just as well
Less work for me

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:36

We worked hard on this, even had a few oldbies look, nothing

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:36

Since I was stripped of even basic commitment resources, I abandoned giving a frak and focused on money earning projects.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:37

Which is fair
Sometimes you just got to take care of yourself man

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:37

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:42

Just for the unofficial record, if you had a vote for the 3rd, I'm interested how you would've voted for excommunication

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:42

Wot?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:42

Would you have kept it, or excommunicated it?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:44

I would have voted that sans eviden e that agn owns it, as I feel they do, tbat the creator owns it. I would have wanted to see the 3rd Colntest threads (404s) and wanted to see the original rules, then .ade a judgement.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:45

Even here where I have no stake and I do not personally care, I have an ethical requirement to rule on the rules of the Contest, the submission, and the content therein.
I ne er .ame arbitrary decisions, nor do I rule on personal bias.
I do not care who you are or what your needs or urgency are: I rule only on the merits.
You saw me rule against you inb our own contest
Despite being your mate, I disagreed and rul3d against  you in favour of someone with whom I share mutual disdain
F3kif tbat does not say that my judgement bias is impartial than you can all frak off

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:49

I can tag you into the archive of the 3rd so you can review what we found so you know everything

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:50

Zco

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:51

If you want to be your own charter, why are you flying an agn flag and creating a rift between me and wl/agn to ensure that op3nzc.orgd functions?
Your new consortiu. Has absolutely no legal authority over a contest from AGN years ago.
You can choose to do what you want, but the legal ownership of those creations is either the content creator or agn,  not some new consortium.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:54

This is equal to making a co.pany. copying MS assets and saying g you ownWin95
You mentioned ZCO above
(replying to @ NightmareJames "The latter.  According to ZCO…"): Here

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:55

Isn't ZC GPL in the first place?  I do not want to get in THIS argument again

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:56

A new group with a new charter can ot simply absorb something to which they have no legal ownership validity
I do not care who owns 3 4 and 5 quests
But to legally own them, you need to have the legal rights to both distribute and to  *modify* them
Ppl ask my opinion on this crud
I can only give a legal opinion
Not my personal opinion

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:58

Then maybe with AlphaDawg gone, excommunicating the 3rd was the right choice
On that
We have the creators of the other two
If you want to go that route

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:58

Ppl 2ho know me already know my personal opinion
I may be able to find AlphaDawgn
Nobody asked

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:59

Not being in charge means having no responsibility  which means having little to no reason to work on this at Ll; then coupled with making it hard to work on it equals NO

## 💊🔓Warn on global variable change? (#976)

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 02:00

Mismatched save data with regards to global variables and arrays seems to trip up new users quite often. Would it be possible to have a compiler setting (on by default) that totals up the size of the global stack before and after compile and displays a warning popup after if it has changed, informing the user that old saves will be incompatible and scripts may behave incorrectly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 02:06

huh, that sounds smart
it could also mention that you can bump the version info in `Header` to prevent users from loading saves that would be corrupted by this

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 02:21

Indeed. Provided Header version info actually works, because I've never actually used it and I don't know anyone who has 🤣

Yeah I've seen these. I know what they do, just never messed with or gotten an error from loading a quest over them
There's a general trend in the ZC community of people being pretty bad at versioning

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 02:42

. . . hmm, so, I'm actually having trouble thinking of a good way to detect that changing
this is a bit more complicated than I thought at first

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 02:44

because, what I need to do, is know what the old value was. How do I do that, exactly? Measuring the size of the init script isn't reliable, as it appends the user init script, so that would detect any init script changes. Given, that could be a good thing. But, it also only detects a *size* change, not a *content* change.
...probably the best I can do, but now the question is how to go about it. This is gonna involve changing a bunch of different things just to process that count, and as such, sadly not gonna finish it tonight.
Also, I need to do it in a way that won't fuck up when we move to external parser, so I need to design it very specifically to avoid future issues

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 03:05

Ah yeah, makes sense. I only suggested it becuase I figured there might be the slimmest of chances it'd be possible without screwing with parser stuff

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 03:06

if it has to do with compiling, it means fucking with parser

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 04:06

OK, well, screw what I said about not finishing it tonight, because I'm insane as usual
well, technically it's past midnight, but meh

hmm, it's cut off at the end
so need to fix the gui, but it's popping up at the correct time
(the `(60->2)` refers to the ZASM linecount of the init script; for the record, `60` is with `std.zh` and `Classic.zh`; `2` is with just `std.zh`)

Notice the `4->4`.... so the size is the same, yet there is a difference detected. Because I changed `int x = 0;` to `int x = 1;` as a global var. That was far easier than I thought it would be....
It eats up a slight chunk more memory for just a moment, as it stores a copy of the entire old init script (to compare to the new one), but that shouldn't be that big an issue
@ Moosh [#builds-255](https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876906918847852594)

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 05:23

Nice!
Did not expect this one to be an overnight addition

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 05:55

The big thing I realized was, a previous change of mine made script data it's own struct (instead of just being a map of data); which made it fairly simple to just... copy the entire script data with a single `=`. Not hard to compare them, either; just a for loop.
Frankly the thing that took the longest was the dialog work
that's a new type of popup dialog, which takes an arbitrary amount of buttons; as both the text, and a function to call when it's clicked.
so, `2, 1, "Header", call_header_dlg, "OK", NULL` is the code for that one
(2 buttons, where `[1]` is the default focus; the OK button, here. The first button says "Header", calling '`void call_header_dlg()`, while the second says "OK", and closes the dialog)
with this, I should be able to make a lot of small customized dialogs, without needing to actually create new dialog code every time
(anything that has a title, textbox, and then buttons)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:43

Is this an option?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:44

No, but you can mash enter to get past it as the `OK` button is selected by default

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:44

Hmm
Might get annoying when youre devving a quedt

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:44

if we get complaints it's easy enough to add a config
but, that will be easier once I've redone the `Etc->Options` dialog

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:45

Can I request a config now?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:45

sure.... I'll get to it once I've redone the `Etc->Options` dialog

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:45

This is really cool btw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:46

You should see the actual dialog code for it
because, it takes *arbitrary buttons*
You could call it with 5 buttons that run 5 different functions

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:46

...actually, what is the max version a quest can have?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:46

...well, 4, because one button needs to run `NULL`, as that's what closes the dialog
uh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:47

it's a 9 character *string*
and they are compared via `strcmp()`
so, for instance, you could do `00.00.01`, and then it would recognize `02.00.00` as "greater"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:48

Oof

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:49

```cpp
if(QHeader.minver[0])
{
    if(strcmp(g->version,QHeader.minver) < 0)
        ret = qe_minver;
}
```

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:50

Im not familiar with strcmp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:50

....not sure what it would make of `0.0.0` vs `10.10.10`, though
or `0.9.0` vs `0.0.10`
time for online compiler for fast testing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:53

`0.9.0` > `0.0.10`
`10.10.10 > 0.0.0`
so, that seems to work as one would hope

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:55

`10.0.0 > 0.99.99`

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 06:55

For real?
Here I would've assumed it just discards decimal places past the first

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:55

```
Compares the C string str1 to the C string str2.

This function starts comparing the first character of each string. If they are equal to each other, it continues with the following pairs until the characters differ or until a terminating null-character is reached.

This function performs a binary comparison of the characters. For a function that takes into account locale-specific rules, see strcoll.```
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) that's `strcmp`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:56

Okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:56

(replying to @ Moosh "For real?"): yep, versioning is important to have multiple places
basically how this comparison works is, if it hits a decimal in one before the other, it knows it has less digits in that 'place', thus it knows which is better
if they are the same through a decimal, it would hit that check for the next 'place'

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 06:57

For actual developers, yeah. This is a little used feature in a program from the early 2000's though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:57

and if they are same length, but different values, it would compare the actual numbers

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 06:58

Would it think 1.0.1 is less than 1.0.000?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:58

See i was gonna suggest a config option to bump up the subversion when it detects this stuff, but that sounds nightmarish now

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 06:59

That sounds like it'd just annoy people and go unused tbh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:59

`1.0.1` > `1.0.000`
basically, `1.0.` == `1.0.`
then `1 > 0`
it goes char by char
now,

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 07:00

I mean, the way it works nowvis that it shows a popup each time it happens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:00

`1.0.1 < 1.00.1`
....so try to make your `0`'s consistent

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 07:00

yeah that's what I was thinking of. I stuck the extra 0's in the wrong place
not that any sane person would do that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:01

I could probably write a new function to compare them and catch things like that
basically, if the strings contain nothing but numbers and `.`'s, read each number as a number, and compare values, one by one

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 07:04

Wait a sec is this all just strcmp? If I have my quest at version `Necromancer` and upgrade it into `WhyWouldYouDoThis`, would that count as an increase in version?
no it wouldn't because neither of those fit in the text field

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:06

It fits 9 chars

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 07:06

But if I wanted to be absolutely mad I could version my quest with arbitrary strings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:07

`banana > apple`
because `b > a` at the first comparison
keeping in mind that `a > Z`, as all capitals are in a row before the lowercases start
and it is case-sensitive compare

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:19

K, made a new function
`1.0.1 == 1.00.1`
If any character in the string is not either a number or a decimal, it just returns `strcmp()` still, so alphabetic shit would still work as expected
but, if it's all numbers + decimals, it tries to compare it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:26

incase anyone cares to inspect, here it is:
```cpp

        avec.push_back(0);
    while(bvec.size() < avec.size())

        if(avec.at(q) > bvec.at(q))
            return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:28

`zc_malloc`/`zc_free` are zc-wrapper-versions of `malloc` and `free`, which basically make an array with a size not known at compile time (here, with whatever size the input strings are)
(and yes that is a good chunk of pointer shenanigans, because it makes it easier)

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 07:32

~~ZScript malloc when~~ (this is joke pls do not take seriously)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:35

I mean, legitimately wouldn't be hard with how arrays work internally
just gotta spend the time to put together the logic for it
(It wouldn't work quite like C++, but it would be a function like `ResizeArray(arr, size, 0)` (the `0` being `fill any new space with 0s`)
I feel like last time I looked at it that was the plan I had, anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 10:00

@ Moosh So that last build actually has a couple *crashes* that my test quest didn't catch. Might wanna grab the new one.
Also, the new one includes `ResizeArray()`. It doesn't take a thing to fill the space with, it's just:```cpp
void ResizeArray(untyped[] arr, int size);
 * Resizes the array 'arr' to size 'size'.
 * If size is <1, the array will be resized to size '1'.```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 10:09

Here's the test case
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/900564083097600002/900687124758683648/unknown.png)
It uses the same function that array declaration uses, because that's already just a resizing operation. So, it should have every new index be `0`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 10:20

.....except wait fuck that's not working dammit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 10:21

oh duh, I see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 10:24

ahk, fixed it
[#builds-255](https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876906918847852594)
So, if you size up an array, it fills the new area with `0`
if you size down an array, it obviously just chops the end off and leaves the same area in tact.
Technically then, if you size it down and back up, you can clear a chunk off the end of it
....probably not the best way to do so, though; memset() is much better.
Also, the cool thing is, from what I understand, global arrays resizing *should save in the save file*, as you would hope it would.
It saves a `count` followed by that number of indexes; but the count is determined by the same thing that `SizeOfArray()` reads, which clearly is changed.
Anyway, night.

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/21/2021 02:54

Like I said in dev discussion,  I hope it's not too late to suggest/request a few things on the enemy sound side of things. I would like to suggest an optional "see/sight" sound for when an enemy first spawns, an "active" sound that plays at random intervals while the enemy is still alive and an "attack/projectile" sound that can overwrite the default sound effect for when a projectile is shot from an enemy. Kinda like how classic Doom does it.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 04:22

wait we don't have shot sounds?
that sounds important
also as said i thought all enemies already had the "boss roar" thing as you see in isle of rebirth
even darknuts can have one

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/21/2021 04:24

Yes but the boss roar is constant, without randomized periods of silence between them
ergo, it doesn't really count

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 04:26

hmm well in that case a QR or a checkbox for each enemy would certainly work
but it should still use the sound # field to conserve qst filesize

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 04:28

the point would be to have multiple different sounds for the same enemy
and the file size cost wouldn't be much, especially since SFX are `byte` sized

=== @ Orithan 10/21/2021 14:22

The ZScript compiler crashes after two unsuccessful compiles in a given session. This triggers on the second failed compile of the session. When it crashes on the second fail varies. Sometimes it will report the error and then crash after you click the prompt while at other times it will crash before then.

Build: Latest nightly.
OS: Windows 10.

The main exception being the include paths file being modified to suit the paths where my script files are stored.

well the `.exe` you are using there is not the latest nightly

This is the exe that's in the latest alpha

=== @ Orithan 10/22/2021 01:24

I literally downloaded the most recent package and this is the exe I have

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 01:25

Aye, that's 6 hours more recent a build than your previous screenshot
Is it still crashing in that build? Because I can't replicate it

=== @ Orithan 10/22/2021 01:30

I was replicating it last night but I can't seem to replicate it now
Even after repeating the steps used to cause that crash

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 01:30

(replying to @ Orithan "The error that is being throw…"): ^If you were replicating it in this build, that makes sense

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/900751011055009814/900919227580563498/unknown.png)
Pretty sure you were using the top one there, and said crashes were fixed in the bottom one there

=== @ Orithan 10/22/2021 01:32

I have no idea how I downloaded that one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 01:33

<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400> you had a `12:57 AM` build time, so it happened.
anyway, given that the crashes were indeed fixed, I'll close this

## Fire Gleeok Shot Timer Editing (#979)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 20:47

See title. This enemy shoots way too quickly to ever let Link get a hit in, especially in old quests where it's only vulnerable to melee weapons. A script would also be okay in my book but @ NightmareJames may or may not want that

=== @ NightmareJames 10/21/2021 21:07

I think this needs to be addressed.  I'd prefer an enemy editor window (in frames) for shot delay

=== @ Mitsukara 11/05/2021 21:22

I absolutely like the idea of being able to adjust this. I made an FFC script in my 6rh quest where, if there were two or more EW_FIREs onscreen, it would set the gleeok's weapon to EW_NONE until the fires went away, making it so it could only fire two at a time (technically I think I made it a script argument, so you could just change the number arbitrarily to limit exactly how many fires)
I also liked the idea of trying to make the fire gleeok flash as a warning before it shoots (a la Trinexx), but didn't implement such a thing in that script.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 15:55

@ Mitsukara check my thread in [#dev-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876908472728453161) about enemy rebalancing, your scripts could be a huge help

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 15:58

i know npc scripts have something about "reverse direction" that could be useful for my anti-homing ideas for gleeok heads/patras

=== @ NightmareJames 11/07/2021 11:21

Could we have some test quests of these scripts @ Mitsukara ?  Like to see these in action
## The ability to disable items in certain map screens (#980)

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/22/2021 01:47

This would mainly be used for Dungeon type maps. Besides depending on the Disable items in Dmaps, you could now disable items on any map screen you choose simply by entering the ID of the item in a Text box in screen data.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 01:48

adding more things to screen data takes a TON of memory

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/22/2021 01:48

Oh
ok

=== @ P-Tux7 10/22/2021 04:57

this is easy
step 1: make two dmaps that have the same level, but different banned items
step 2: have side warps between the two screens take you to the correct screen on dmaps 1 and 2
so it looks like link is just walking to the next screen, and he keeps all his map, compass, boss key, and level keys, but it's really a different map
with different banned items
and when he walks back, it goes back to the original map

=== @ P-Tux7 10/22/2021 05:00

and of course to save on "real" map space, all of those dmaps can use the same "real" map
so both dmaps use the same "real" map, just the warp sets the "dmap" as the one with banned items
i can make a demo quest tomorrow if needed
## 💊🔓DS_PHANTOM broken with new sprite drawing. (#981)

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 14:57

Usually the DS_PHANTOM DrawStyle would give weapon sprites transparency as with draw commands. With the Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing rule on they still do

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/901122140261195836/901122156614807612/unknown.png)
However when I use the new drawing that allows for scaling and rotation, I get this
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/901122140261195836/901122290534715402/unknown.png)
Appears to just be averaging the colors with black and completely ignoring whatever's underneath

=== @ Moosh 11/12/2021 10:14

boop

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/12/2021 10:22

gah
you know what's happening?
It's doing the transparency at the wrong step
to a sub-bitmap
which is clear
so it's averaging it with color 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:15

.....yeeeeep, I was correct
blehg
I basically need to rewrite the new sprite draw code, like, almost entirely
god fucking dammit zoria, can't even design something as basic as this correctly....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:26

. . . so the problem is, the cloaked/transparent draw functions used are direct tile draws
I need a version that is a bitmap blit
so it can take the rotated/scaled image as input

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:29

transparent is easy enough, but *cloaked* draws are going to be a fucking pain
because they
are like

so much memory bullshit that I literally don't know what it's doing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:32

so uh, cloaked is not gonna work right without a lot of work
phantom should be an easy enough fix, though

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 07:42

At least cloaked is the more niche of the two
Though I assume you can't really fix one without also fixing the other, or at least laying down the foundation to do so?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:43

I'm going to make it so if you set it to cloaked it ignores rotation/scaling, for now
(just making it use the old draw code as though the QR were on)
which is simple enough
and *hopefully* I've just fixed the phantom one
as transparency functions are common enough, so shouldn't need anything too fancy, just needed a bit of rearranging

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:49

see if this works?

Yeah this is very broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:59

.....hmmm

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 07:59

Link is invisible and my phantom weapons are showing up cloaked with black flicker

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:59

so uh, the title screen is most certainly a separate issue
I noticed some title screen fuck up in a few recent builds
....though that's far worse than what I saw
feel like something to do with modules is fucked up there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:02

.....what the fuck would be making Link invisible, though???

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:03

You just have 1x1 tile link, right?
and, what size are the weapons?

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:05

1x1 weapons. 1x2 Link

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:06

OK, so, I only modified 1x1
so if something's wrong with a 1x2 link
then there's something really weird going on here
maybe it just build-bugged.... let me rebuild clean

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:07

It's all sprites
Enemies are invisible as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:07

what the fuck
literally all I did is make it so in the spot it normally does either `draw tile, draw trans tile, draw cloaked tile`
now it just does `draw tile`
so anything with a drawstyle that isn't phantom/cloaked should be fucking *exactly the same*

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:09

Sounds like this stuff is more complicated than it seemed then?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:09

unless MSVC just decided to fuck up the build
so I'm rebuilding from clean
and hopefully that will magically fix it

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:10

Alrighty then
I take it that's just a thing that happens sometimes

I haven't changed anything related to the title screen
in literally days
so that's all some other unrelated issue
that apparently can randomly crash
ffs

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:29

I mean it's very unstable and apparently reading random data for graphics
so it's not out of the question some of what's causing that could cause random crashes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:30

I don't have any idea why that's doing any of that
it just started doing it a couple days ago
and it probably has something to do with zoria's module bullshit
which frankly never should have fucking touched title screen stuff
jesus

any chance you could make a smaller test quest that showcases the issues?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 09:13

huh
the title screen thing is based on the last quest you loaded
what the fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 09:50

I WANT TO FUCKING KILL SOMEONE
WHAT THE FUCK
SO
```cpp
if(drawstyle==0 || drawstyle==3) overtile16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));
else if(drawstyle==1) overtiletranslucent16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip),128);
else if(drawstyle==2) overtilecloaked16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));```
this is a code block
it does opaque if drawstyle is 0 or 3
trans if 1
and cloaked if 2
changing it to this
```cpp
overtile16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));
```
makes it not fucking work and everything is invisible
despite that, for a drawstyle of 0 or 3, *it is literally the same fucking block of code*
and ***even fucking stupider***
```cpp
if(drawstyle==0 || drawstyle==3) overtile16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));
else if(drawstyle==1) overtile16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));
else if(drawstyle==2) overtile16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));

Moldorms currently have hardcoded animation - one tile for New Enemy Tiles off, their usual setup for New Enemy Tiles on. You can see that their Animation Style is empty. Requesting a Moldorm animation style (which is 4-frame 8-dir + 2 copy rows) and for this to no longer be linked to the QR
might be useful for scripted enemies to be able to access such a kind of animation too, like emily's splitting moldorm

Requesting Armos working on layers now that layer stuff is being worked on. Both me and @ Falco are interested in this
(btw falco, the reason i said there's layer stuff being worked on is that emily just got pushblocks working on layers - including them producing their layer's screen's undercombo beneath them)

=== @ Falco 10/23/2021 21:44

cool, cool
why was I interested in this again? 🙂
*doesn't remember*
I remember being interested in walkable armos combos...

=== @ Falco 10/23/2021 21:46

that is cool though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 21:51

Pushblocks were dead easy.... armos look a *lot* harder

=== @ Falco 10/23/2021 21:54

you sure it was me, P-Tux?
Like I said, I remember suggesting armos combos be available to trigger as walkable combos (as in, you walk across them, and an enemy spawns)
I don't remember layers though

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2021 21:55

Believe 2.55 can already do that can't it? Just with a step->next into generic with enemy spawning

=== @ Falco 10/23/2021 21:55

well
I ended up sort of half and halfing it with walkability. As in, checkerboard patterning the walkability of the combo
somehow that actually worked

=== @ P-Tux7 10/23/2021 21:59

that might be problematic if spawning enemies can hurt you

=== @ Falco 10/23/2021 22:08

They dont.
Mine don't anyways
Quest rules.
Or... something
It's been a minute
But I do know I didn't have trouble with that when I got things going
It was utilized to simulate gels coming out of the floor like in Alttp, and actually worked nicely

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2021 07:56

From my understanding bridge combos are supposed to unset solidity bits for all layers under them. And to have a bridge cover half a combo, you can use the effect squares to mark which bits it overrides. But I'm only managing to get a bridge that overrides the full tile

I gotta say this feature is excellent. I threw together a basic over/under script in a little under an hour when before this was a major multi day headache. Of course the "simple" part might be a part of this, it doesn't interact with enemies

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "How'd this help you do that?"): I imagine the fact that you don't need to make walkable versions of every combo and manually change swap between them for the combos on the under part

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 04:48

Apparently, the "Start with 999 rupees" quest rule was misinterpreted when updated for newer quests in 1.90. Apparently, it's a quest rule intended to start you with the level 2 wallet. However, this seems to have been forward ported as starting with actually 999 rupees. The intended behavior should be starting with a *max* of 999 rupees, not starting with 999 rupees.

=== @ tim 10/28/2021 04:49

looks like i also misunderstood that one
i was under impression of amount and not wallet back then, but never used the rule

message strings were broken by being 1 too short both width and heightwise, a bug I fixed a while back for everything but 1.90 quests cause, again, those are handled in their own if statement

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 18:38

subscreen couldn't even be opened, because, again, subscr speed initialized as 0 instead of 1 when only the 1.90 if statement runs

ok so it seems like arrows are meant to go that far inside dungeons inside 1.90, i know at least one quest that takes advantage of this that doesn't work right in 2.50

Disregard that, I figured out what line of code broke this behavior

I need to check when exactly it got added though

i can do a quick test in b183

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 03:46

we don't have any source code between those two versions

=== @ tim 10/29/2021 03:47

my copy of 2.10 is from 1/1/2005
let me see if i can open it

It seems like 2.10.3 was just a ZQuest update looking at this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 04:07

Also it's only the source code
I don't think I can build it
(can't find a date for 2.10.3 or 2.10.2 in the source files... figures)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 05:10

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i think keese tribbles also g…"): as far as I can tell, the source code already has code for this
Does anyone here have an example of a 1.90 quest with tribble enemies so I can test this out?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 17:43


https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903143138741350410/903700503517610044/TRIBBLES.QST
so go to cheats, type "zelda" and cheat yourself the White Sword and then wait for the tribbles to grow up
if the keese tribble grows up into a blue vire, GOOD. if it grows up into a black vire, BAD
and now test the zol you see by hitting it with the white sword. if it dies in one hit, GOOD, it's a regular zol. if it doesn't, it's a zol tribble, which is BAD
so in summary tribbles in 1.90 quests are supposed to grow up into their ORDINARY versions not tribble versions
also sorry, gels and zols look identical to their tribbles in 1.90 (both use the same tiles and cset 9), nothing i could do to expedite that

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 10:40

I can't remember if we agreed to have it flaggable or not
I'd prefer to have it togglable via emulation flags for 2.50 and below to avoid issues TBH
And let rules take care of it from 2.50 plus

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 12:48

That's the plan
I'm asking if it's currently in ZC or not
Or if all pre-2.5 quests are broken

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 12:51

I'll put it on my list to review.  RN taking care of 1.  5th Quest Whistle addition and 2.  Next recording, in addition to IRL stuff. Probably deal with it next week or on my next major time off.  🙂

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 13:10

no problem, i've got this

=== @ P-Tux7 11/04/2021 08:06

oh, something else i need to check in 1.90 (and possibly 1.92/2.10) is lanmola spawning
in quite a few quests i've seen they can't move at where they spawn, implying that they used to spawn in psuedorandom locations like other dungeon enemies
come to think of it i should check blue wizzrobe spawn patterns in those versions too...

=== @ tim 11/04/2021 17:24

is it mostly screen edges?
ive def seen stationary in the middle of the screen though... not sure what causes it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/04/2021 17:28

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "in quite a few quests i've se…"): Is it Hookshot 1 you're thinking of?
Cause I know it's an injoke there

=== @ P-Tux7 11/04/2021 17:50

no i mean 1.90-2.10 quests lol
(replying to @ tim "ive def seen stationary in th…"): more like middle to the left
i think that's where they always spawn in z1 (you know like how gleeoks always spawn in one place), and someone fixed it from 1.90 to 2.50, but failed to make the old behaviour still apply to 1.90 quests in 2.50

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 00:37

invisible enemies in 1.90 were completely invisible a la zelda 2. not cloaked.
i need to test if this applies to their projectiles
i'm not sure if the amulet was in 1.84 because 1.84 was 1.90 with half the inventory missing but let's make the version check "1.90 or below" just in case

=== @ P-Tux7 12/24/2021 03:39

ok so according to haylee apparently swimming in 1.90 (and 1.92? idk) had something a la smart screen scrolling but ONLY when swimming
also in 2.50.2 it seems that the whole "bomb explosions last longer and can kill aquamentus with one bomb" isn't enabled in 1.90 (and 1.92? again idk) quests automatically?

=== @ tim 12/24/2021 03:51

why would it
that's not how it was intended in 1.90/92

=== @ P-Tux7 12/24/2021 03:54

i admit it's not high priority but quests should generally play the same as the version they were made in
and also because iirc there's already a quest rule for it so it's not a big deal to toggle it being turned on automatically in said quests

=== @ P-Tux7 01/23/2022 00:06

ok so the aquamentus thing is somehow a 1.92 only thing. it takes two bombs to kill an aquamentus in 1.90 and the compat rule name is correct.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 09:41

This channel is kinda useless now that compatibility reports are a thing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 09:43

@ P-Tux7 if it's not too much trouble, could you recap the specific issues that you don't think are fixed yet? Either here or in compat rules, either works
I just need to sort out what's a bug that needs to be fixed and what's an observation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 13:20

(meta) thread name was changed: 🔓1.90 compat bugs

=== @ P-Tux7 02/08/2022 18:15

yeah i am
i've already made a few channels and have been in the process of testing a few more
turns out that lanmolas and manhandlas do NOT have per-segment drops in 1.90 - that was a bug introduced in 1.92, just like the aquamentus 1-hit bomb kill

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:49

check if lanmola spawn location is hardcoded in 1.90 and check if "entering screen on a water combo + ladder causes softlock" bug from 2.50.2 is still extant in Puzzle Quest

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 22:43

same as above
@ Moosh i recall you scripted some of these quirks into armageddon quest 2. any that you did besides the windrobes?
(meta) thread name was changed: 1.92 2.10 compat bugs

=== @ Moosh 10/28/2021 22:45

Believe windrobes were the only thing

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 00:12

okay so 2.53 (and 2.55?) has native code for the windrobe thing in the emulation menu
now all that needs to be done @<role: Developer> is making it auto-run when quest ver is 2.10 or less
(instead of the emulation menu)
oh sorry for the ping i thought developer was just emily and dimi

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 00:15

yeah nope it's a few people
try to direct ping instead of role ping

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 00:17

i didn't wanna single anyone out but yeah

=== @ Moosh 10/29/2021 00:23

It was my understanding I thought that emulation rules were made optional rather than mandatory because different quests were made for different subversions of ZC, especially in the 1.92 days
It's a messy solution but then ZC is a messy program

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 00:23

nah iirc it was because 2.50 was out of QRs to auto-activate

=== @ Moosh 10/29/2021 00:24

Right, the reason they're a toggle menu, not the reason they exist in the first place

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 00:26

@ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) made them

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 00:27

not to put too fine a point on it but i don't think he cares anymore

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 00:33

of course we're free to reuse the code though

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/29/2021 06:17

I was going to make the windrobe fix an enemy flag, not a qr, for 2.55 and auto enable it for older quests.
Same for other enemy fixes.
Some of the emulation could become rules.
Some may be best to keep as emulation options in the player.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 17:54

yeah, i was going to feature request that since OUCH! has stated they prefer the old windrobes
though i couldn't do it here since this is strictly for bugs

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/29/2021 19:06

Enemy variation always belongs on enemy flags, not on a global rule.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 19:58

oh yeah and from 1.92-2.10
"rope 2s do not flash" should assign them cset 9, not 8

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 02:08

#990

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 07:59

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) speaking of armageddon quest
has the whole "door repairs in gamble dungeon never exhaust, they keep draining you every time you enter because it's in a dungeon" thing been emulated
i thought it was a rule in 2.50.2 already but i remember someone complaining that it broke in 2.50.2

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 08:00

hmm

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:02

oh and also while we're at it
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&id=744
(744)
would you mind asking ouch what broke and needed changing for 2.53
because they'll care more if it's from an actual dev

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 08:06

robber's mansion most likely
the left path was broken because of lanmolas not counting as ringleaders IIRC

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:15

oh mm
fixed yet? dare i ask

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 08:28

no clue
I think they did something else for that room

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:40

so what's the issue
they DID or DIDN'T count in 1.92

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 08:41

they did count
every other enemy in the room is a phantom ghini
unkillable

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:50

well that's odd

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 08:59

so for some reason they no longer killed those ghinis when they died

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 18:26

@ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) which 1.92 version swapped cancel and wavy warps

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 20:53

build 163

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 20:54

@ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 20:54

thanks!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 20:54

fun fact, the rule internally is named qr_192b163

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 20:54

well then

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 20:54

and before was emu192b163

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 20:54

sorry for the ping timelord

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 20:55

thank god, cause I couldn't find the topic about it on the old dev server

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 21:12

@ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) out of curiosity do you have any of the four(?) "1.93" builds

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 21:23

ok so link's bad hair day 4 confirmed to not be bugged in B104. let's see about 183 now
(for reference, the bug is that the overworld's "cave" things such as text and shops show on their respective overworld screen without you entering the cave)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/31/2021 13:24

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "@ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) out of…"): No, I have a set of *seven* 1.93 builds.
I am uncertain what differentiates  '× from 'ws' designations
I have alpha 4 as d, s, w, and 'ws'
Alpha 5 as dos and windows
And alpha 6 as windows

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 17:50

lay em on me please

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/01/2021 14:56

I will wait for @EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) to make a channel so that no-one have a reason to complain about ot posts.

That works
It was specific to 1.92 before
1.93 is 2.50 alpha

this upgraded newfirst from 1.92 beta 68b has the same issue as LBHD4
i.e. the cave guys appear on their respective overworld screens

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:11

presumably same for "newfirst_enhanced.qst" from beta 91

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i.e. the cave guys appear on…"): Oh yeah, I fixed this
Haven't posted the nightly for it yet
thanks to @ Rambly for being kind and helping me iron out that bug

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:30

what was the problem?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2021 14:30

dmap flags

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 14:31

there was an early breakpoint that was missed

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:31

oh mm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 14:31

and the code we had to do this was after that

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:31

looking in the quest itself it *said* the overworld map was an Overworld
are there any known quests that this affects besides Link's Bad Hair Day 4 and the two Newfirst test .qsts?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2021 14:33

it'd be every quest in that version

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:33

actually rambly if you can see this i'd like to ask you that, I'd like to play more of them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2021 14:33

but should be fixed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 15:00

It is fixed yeah
overworld types used to include those flags implicitly
but it wasn't actually setting those flags when upgrading to versions that split the type and the flags

=== @ Rambly 11/02/2021 16:15

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "actually rambly if you can se…"): one of these days im just gonna upload my whole quest archives
im busy lately so it might be a bit, but i'd like to
also um, mountain drew's hitchhiker's guide quest
to answer more directly

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 16:57

thanks!
also holy shit that's a thing?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 17:00

ok so i dmed ouch and the only compatibility bug that they remember is that lanmola ringleaders do not kill the other enemies when killed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 17:34

yeah, I need to look into that

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:20

I guess that those builds were of some use.
1.90 go 1.93 bugs are by far the worst.
2.10 is not that bad

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:22

It was helpful for checking a quest I couldn't open in 2.55

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:23

2.0.0, 2.10.1., 2.10.2, and the unreleased 2.10.3 source files re all on GH as brqnches
That is why I spent so much effort pestering ppl to send w/e they had and archiving it all in a coherent manner alongside my files
Behavioural observations help substantially

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:25

granted, it's not as helpful as actual source files
1.83 source would be huge
as would 1.90 source

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:25

1.80 was only the player
The 1.50 src is the closest stopgap
There was no public zq bin until iirc 1.83

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:27

1.83 source, I meant

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:27

I was lucky to get one 1.92 zrc pack, even incomplete
Are there any 1.84 to 1.90 issues that are unsolved?
The majority of fekked up regular changes were 1.92 to 1.93

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:29

it'd give a nice insight whenever it comes to quests made in those versions

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:29

Shrug
Look at the 1.50 src
It is so different that it isn't reasonably comprehensible compared to 2.50
I wrote a quest loader for 1.50 quests but never tested it
I wanted to convert Jer's 3rd to 2.53
Was meant to be the original official 3rd
And nobody in the general userbase have played it, few know it exists
I literally spent over two years hunting down what you have and pestering wl to find old media with files
The family of DNbmight still have his 20 year old drives but I did not want to ask them for something like that
DarkNation

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:35

I do not liking askeling parents of a deceased child for that sort of thing. I have been there and I know what memories it would resurface if it were done to me.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:37

You are 9f course welcome to do what you want.
Perhaps wl may one day find more

i remember a video of dcsyxx swearing while playing soshi's quest because he dies while playing a 1.92 quest in 1.92 and knows the gohma 3 that he killed will respawn as it's not in a boss room lol

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 19:35

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) has 1.92 beta 104 quests having overworld guys show up outside their caves been fixed yet?
it doesn't seem to be in a recent nightly
and is it possible for me to manually fix it in zquest for the time being

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 19:38

oh i think it may not be setting use caves instead of item cellars or special rooms and guys are in caves only, for overworld dmaps in those quests
yup setting both of those fixed it, not sure which one
probably the second

someone SAID din's fire should trigger wand book fire triggers in their 2.10 quest but it's not doing so in 2.50.2

deedee i'm afraid you'll have to test this one on your own
just make a quest in 1.92 or 2.10 that gives you din's fire and has a wand book fire combo flag, and see if the din's fire fire triggers that please

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2021 03:08

@ P-Tux7 if you want to test 2.10 stuff, you need to do some weird stuff
you need to make a shortcut of ZQ, edit the shortcut, add "-w" after the path
should work

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:11

thanks!
does that apply to zelda-w as well?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:13

```C:\Users\PTux7\Downloads\zc210w\zquest-w.exe -w```
huh, this doesn't work
do i need to enclose either one of the "words" in quotes?
(either the file path or the -w)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:14

file path should only need quotes if it includes spaces
flags should never be quoted

=== @ Moosh 11/24/2021 03:15

Mine just looks like
`zelda-w.exe -windowed`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:15

ah thanks that worked!

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:17

...wait, will that work for anyone else?
i put what moosh said for both (changing zelda to zquest of course) but when i open the shortcuts back up it's my file path again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:27

that'd be how shortcuts work
so no
afaik to make it work for someone else you'd need to use a batch file
...which should be able to just have the same exact text in it and work

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:28

okay it triggers flag 74 in 2.10
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903413814618378300/912907547705491456/dinsfire.qst
okay why can't i use din's fire in the latest alpha it has no cost in this quest.
related to #1053 ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:29

wtf

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:30

uh yeah uh no
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903413814618378300/912907952875257886/unknown.png)
magic was disabled in that 2.10 quest so nothing should use magic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:31

it should cost rupees instead, then
iirc
and if the `enable magic` qr is unchecked, it should cost rupees when the cost counter is set to magic

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:34

said qr is unchecked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:34

so it should be costing 32 rupees then
I would think

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:34

no, it shouldn't, since din's fire cost 0 rupees in 2.10 when magic was disabled
don't ask why

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:34

interesting
check if having 32 rupees works
definitely a compat bug, regardless

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:36

ok it works fine in 2.50.2
no rupees or magic needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:36

. . . wtf

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:36

though as i said, it's not triggering the wand book fire flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:36

OK, so 2 bugs
`Din's Fire triggers Book Fire Flag`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:36

so let me mod in some rupees in that 2.10 quest and see if it triggers said flag in the latest 2.55 build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:37

and `2.10 porting: if no enable magic, cost should be 0 for dins fire`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:37

*2.10.2 or less
din's fire was in some late 1.92 builds iirc

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:41

ok so 2 things
1. din's fire does not trigger the wand book fire flag in the latest build
2. din's fire only VALIDATES cost, it does not remove 32 rupees

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:41

??????

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:41


https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903413814618378300/912910868554080286/dinsfire.qst

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:42

Is the `only validate cost` flag being checked in the editor????

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:42

(go down one screen to get the 50 rupees)
no?!?

What the *fuck*

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:43

again it seems similar to #1053
though in that case it DOES have enough rupees to validate the cost yet still does not work

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 03:53

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "though as i said, it's not tr…"): can confirm the 2.10 source does the check for wand fire when it goes to trigger dins fire stuff

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 03:54

need to see if it's also in 1.92 (since I believe Din's Fire was first added there) and then see which 2.50 RC it got changed in

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:42

ah
so zoria fucked the cost
it's checking rupees for the cost
but then it's charging your magic

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:48

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "need to see if it's also in 1…"): would you mind if its a qr or item setting or something that the user can set, and not just auto-changed in the zc player? i like it
since logically a bigger magical fire item should be able to trigger a smaller magical fire item's trigger

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:50

. . . you keep asking things like this
it literally ***HAS*** to be a qr or item setting
for it to function in old quests
that's not an optional thing
"auto-changed in the zc player" is not a way things can be fixed

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:51

i could have sworn at least 2.50.2 hid some of those compatibility options in zquest but i could be wrong

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:51

2.50.2 did
which is, in itself, a 2.50.2 bug
because the devs didn't give enough of a crap about compatibility

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:51

see also: sideview damage combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:52

doing it like that is not fixing the bug

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:52

sorry for the confusion, that must be where i got the idea that zelda.exe can automagically detect and change stuff from

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:52

it's causing a compat bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:59

oh blehg
the cost shit here is really messed up
god dammit zoria
there's an item flag
that is no longer editable
that controls a thing\
and wasn't ported quite right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 05:07

so this will still be broken in any quests loaded since around the time I started devving
but should be fixed for any old quests loaded in new versions now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 05:14

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "no, it shouldn't, since din's…"): this wasn't dins
it was all items
but there was a *flag* to make it cost rupees

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 08:11

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i could have sworn at least 2…"): Yeah, it used to, but it's easier for us to have it be quest rules and stuff
or item rules, or etc
it's gonna be an item quest rule instead of a compat rule
cause it's more subjective whether you'd want it or not, as opposed to compat rules just fixing bugs

=== @ P-Tux7 12/06/2021 03:29

Oh... it seems part of the Beta 104 bug where Guys show up outside of their caves also means that their screens are flagged to have Stairways (like you'd find in a dungeon), not Caves.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/06/2021 03:31

Oh, it's not setting "Use Caves Instead of Item Cellars" properly

=== @ P-Tux7 12/31/2021 20:24

oh dear, i'm going to have to check how "Start with 999 Rupees" works in 1.90, 1.92, and 2.10
i know that to the top (2.10) INTENDS for you to start with a full 999 rupee counter + wallet

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/31/2021 22:25

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i know that to the top (2.10)…"): IIRC it just uses init data to start you with 999 rupees

=== @ P-Tux7 12/31/2021 23:35

ah good
i was worried it was broken back in 2.10 and we'd have to emulate it separately between 1.84 and 2.10
(i wonder if that rule existed in 1.84... i haven't even downloaded that one yet because until now it just seemed like 1.90 but worse)

write up report for 1.92 beta 104 (and presumably all 1.92 betas below that?) overworlds being broken - check if they are missing Use Caves Instead of Item Cellars, Guys Are Inside Caves/Special Rooms Only, or both map flags when played in 2.5x
i know enabling *both* fixes them... i just forgot to check if it's specifically one or the other

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:53

Frankly, it would be good if you could start moving anything that isn't fixed yet from these channels to [#compat-bug-reports](https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/932919361415577661)

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:53

those builds are kind of wacky... their quests still use 1.90 password encryption instead of 1.92's, as proven by ZCheat
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Frankly, it would be good if…"): ...yeah, that's what "write up report" is telling myself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:53

but like
just make a thread
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "write up report for 1.92 beta…"): put this in it
and then add more details to that same thread later

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:54

oh i can? i thought it had to be the whole enchilada at the start
thanks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:54

. . .
Well these messages we are sending right now
certainly are not the first message in the thread
so I don't see what would stop you from... doing the same... in any other thread.....

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:55

because i don't intend these as formal bug reports? (at least after i requested the compat bug reports channel)
for example, there was the case of me questioning if 1.90 lanmolas/manhandlas had individual segment drops, so i made a note in that general thread to test it later
turns out they didn't
so there was no compat bug and no reason to make a thread

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:57

But like
you could have made a thread
and then
said `yeah nope, all good`
and closed it

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:59

that's fine? and not a bother? well okay then if you say so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 06:00

it's much less of a bother than having threads that just have like 5000 unrelated topics in them
better to close things off when they are done

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 06:00

yeah ok
i'll get to it tomorrow copy pasting on mobile sucks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 06:01

oh, fuck, yeah don't try that on mobile lol
and no particular rush
not like we're hurting for things to work on at the moment
## ✅🔒Wizzrobe flag for teleporting style (#990)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 02:08

Request from OUCH! and Timelord to have a flag for Wizzrobes that chooses between the teleport style for Orange/Wind ones (that is, lined up with the player) and Bat/Summoner (randomly on any valid tile, respecting a certain minimum distance from the player). In other words, it is decoupled from their EWeapon style and moved to a flag. The ones in qst.dat are updated to have the correct flag set. Phasing Wizzrobes are unaffected, but this flag may find use there for something I suggested in the enemy rebalance thread.
The relevant code exists in the Emulation menu, it's just a matter of making the flag check for it.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 04:18

you made this request an hour after I implemented it

## Script access to pickupstring read state (#991)
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) opened this issue on 10/30/2021

Status: open

Labels: ['feature']

Source: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/903905946328260618

Script access `bool Game->ItemStringRead[]`, read/write access to the bits that mark pickup strings as having already been displayed.

This would allow scripts to, say, read the real time clock, and if you haven't played for a while, reset the strings to display again. Or any number of other uses, but that's one that comes to mind immediately.
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 07:21

I'll look into it; I'm not comfortable with adding new ZScript cause I fear it'll break or etc

If you want to vc with me I can walk through it with you again (at some point less 3:30am)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/30/2021 07:29

(i.e. all it takes is knowing the basic steps, and it's not bad)

Idk what this new command is. Itemsprite and it3lemdata PString are both r/w afaik

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 14:20

So, item pickup strings only play once
How does that work? An internal bit is set if they have already been played, of course
....scripts can't read those bits.
## ✅🔒Lanmola 1 Segment = Dead Fix (#992)

Status: fixed

Labels: ['bug']

Source: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/903927601477849088



=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:45

Rebringing this up so we can put a bow on ZC 2.XX. I'll do some test quests tomorrow but I'm pretty sure the issue is that Lanmolas (and moldorms maybe?) count as dead even if you only kill one segment, even if the QR to fix it for Digdoggers is set. I think killing one segment also kills all the bosses in a room if you leave and come back, even if the QR for Must Defeat All Bosses is set. That is to say, similar to a Digdogger in Z1, kill 1 segment, die and come back or exit the room and come back, whole thing is dead. And I think whole room is cleared if it was a Dungeon Boss room

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:47

The obvious first thing to look at (and solution to copy) for clues on how to fix this would be the 3-Digdogger, which has had both issues successfully fixed and does NOT add one to the room's dead enemy count until all 3 kids are killed, and does NOT set the all enemies beaten in that room status or DMap boss room flag status until all 3 kids are killed. With those NESFix rule(s) on of course

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:53

Might also be worth looking into "Temp Set No Return", which is also a QR that messes with Lanmolas. Maybe setting that on or off fixes some of the glitchy behaviour by mistake, similar to how Enemies -> Secret had to be set on to have "Must Hit All Triggerable Combos" secrets in 2.50/3 that didn't activate if you triggered one, left the room, and came back?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:55

Just writing this down for myself tomorrow...

1. Lanmola alone, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments on (if that's a rule?
2. Lanmola alone, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments off
3. Lanmola as part of a boss room, Must Kill All Bosses on, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments on
4. Lanmola as part of a boss room, Must Kill All Bosses on, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments off
5. Lanmola as part of a boss room, Must Kill All Bosses off, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments on
6. Lanmola as part of a boss room, Must Kill All Bosses off, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments off
All of these will be tested by killing one segment, leaving and reentering the room and seeing what happened.
Oh and 7-12 for Tmp. No Return on. This is gonna suck

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 02:38

@ NightmareJames can you give any details that you remember, I recall you saying this during one of your James Quest streams

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 03:31

I'll work on this tomorrow.  I spent a lot of time on ZC tonight.  I need to do some other things

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 10:42

Time for a ton of test quests.........
I don't remember all of it, @ P-Tux7 , start creating the test cases and let's start testing them

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 19:42

Okay so lanmola just sets the "you killed the whole screen" flag when you kill it.
regardless of if there's more than 1 lanmola or etc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 19:47

@ P-Tux7 out of curiosity, is it specifically "you kill one segment, the whole thing counts as dead", or "you kill the lanmola, all enemies count as dead"?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 19:49

i think it's both, i'll have to check
btw what rule is it that determines whether a 3-digdogger counts as dead when you kill all 3 segments or only 1
or is that just lumped into "must kill all bosses"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 19:54

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "btw what rule is it that dete…"): It's "Temporary No Return Disabled"
And that rule *does* seem to affect lanmolas
Okay, Lanmolas don't actually obey "enemy never returns"

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 19:57

ok so i gotta test them as ringleaders
temporary no return disabled
must kill all bosses
and in boss rooms vs non-boss rooms
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "It's "Temporary No Return Dis…"): also is temp set no return a different rule or the same

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 19:58

Temp set no return?
where is this rule?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 19:58

oh it's in the 1.90 docs
must have been renamed then

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 20:00

phantom menace said it was related to "in nes zelda, lanmolas in level 9 don't respawn when you continue, but they do when you leave and re-enter. this rule makes them always return" (or was it "respawn like normal enemies"?)
so perhaps its that rule you said
sorry not at home

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 20:01

so, you know how enemies don't respawn until you go a certain distance away?
that's temp no return

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 20:02

yup
oh hmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 20:02

so, temp no return disabled.... disables that

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 20:03

i'll check where that rule was in the 1.90 rules menu - should be in the same order in the quest rules file, since those are sorted by chronological order

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 20:14

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so, temp no return disabled..…"): No, that's not it
temp no return disabled disables the lanmola and digdoggers counting the whole screen as dead if you kill a single enemy one of them onscreen

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 20:17

I have the source open, it's called in exactly two places, and both of them function as whether or not to check the mapflag "tempnoreturn" or to ignore it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 20:21

tempnoreturn is only set by:
rooms with line of sight traps in it (if a room has line of sight traps and you kill all enemies, the flag is set)
lanmolas whenever you kill one
Digdoggers check the flag, but for some reason they never actually set it
I'm curious if that's a bug that was introduced at some point

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 20:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so, you know how enemies don'…"): the rule that disables this behavior is "Enemies Always Return", and the internal variable for that is game->guys

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 20:26

oh
that's.... really poorly named

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 20:27

are you surprised?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 22:30

aren't ringleaders named superman in the code lmfao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 22:33

no
superman is the invincible variable
used for Link with cheats
and peahats while they are flying

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 22:34

...what
i'm surprised that hasn't blown something up yet
peahats are already awful when they WORK

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 22:57

kill_em_all is the ringleader kill command

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 06:26

@ P-Tux7 are you able to recreate this bug?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 06:53

whoops i'll check tomorrow

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 02:49

downloading latest build...

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 02:55

sorry for the inconvenience but you'll need to use cheat 4 and go to level 1. the lanmolas are in the left room.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903927601477849088/912899306766344262/1stClassic.qst
i needed something with a dungeon template
i checked the rule "must kill all bosses for "no return"" and killing one lanmola, leaving the room, and re-entering gives me the key

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 02:58

okay swapped 'em with aquamentuses and killing one, then leaving and re-entering leaves there one aquamentus
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903927601477849088/912900000571334707/1stClassic.qst
so apparently the issue is that killing one lanmola is just setting the screen as You Killed Everything for some reason
is it something to do with the flag that boss rooms use to know to clear the room of enemies?
does it have something to do with their broken "never returns after death" checkbox? that it's incorrectly telling zc to not return these enemies?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:02

okay so here's phantom menace's description of TempNoReturn
``` - TmpNoRet Disabled: This was my solution to a strange problem in the NES game. Lanmolas stay dead until you exit the dungeon. Also, if you beat everyone in a room that has traps, they stay dead until you exit. I called this "Temp No Return". So for true NES quests, this rule is left unchecked. If checked, lanmolas act as normal enemies, and enemies come back to rooms with traps just as if the traps weren't there. ```

turning that rule on makes it so that when you kill one lanmola and re-enter the room, there's still one lanmola left
that's a little weird but it seems to act as one would expect with tempnoreturn on - unsure if it's worth "fixing" to include lanmolas in the must kill all bosses chicanery if this rule is off. most people have both on, right?
now to test boss rooms

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2021 03:07

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "so apparently the issue is th…"): Could you check "disable temp no return"?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:07

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "turning that rule on makes it…"): ^ i did
that makes it act normal for non-boss rooms at least
now to test it with 2 lanmolas as the level 1 boss

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2021 03:08

Yeah, that's the point of that rule
it's a really shitty named rule

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:08

so the weirdness is that if you kill 1 aquamentus with Must Kill All Bosses on and TmpNoReturn off, it won't kill the other one when you return. but with lanmolas, it does.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:09

okay, seems to work, killing one lanmola and leaving the boss room leads there to be one lanmola remaining (i edited level 1 to have open doors to let you beeline straight to the aquamentus room)
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903927601477849088/912902824340385842/1stClassic.qst
ok things seem normal, but there's one last thing for me to test... i recall some rule that makes it where if you don't kill all the enemies in a Boss Room, you leave, and re-enter, they all respawn - even Z1 bosses (overriding the "Does Not Return After Death" enemy attribute)?
i'm not sure where that rule is but once i know i'll test that too

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:03

like i could have sworn there was this rule or something in some quests in pre-2.5 versions, which was preserved when you played said quests in 2.5, where if you had a room full of Manhandlas and killed one, then died, all 10 of them would be back the next go-round. what rule was that? i need to check how lanmolas interact with it

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:04

or am i going barmy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 04:31

Must kill all bosses to set No Return

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:32

different from must kill all bosses?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 04:37

what's the QR name for that
I've changed the QR name on my end cause it was confusing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:44

guessing the issue is that qr doesn't count lanmolas as bosses

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:44

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "what's the QR name for that"): "must kill all bosses"? near the top of enemy QRs
whats the name of the "...to set no return" rule
perhaps it should go right under must kill all bosses?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:45

6th enemy qr from the top?
if so then it's the same rule, just renamed

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:46

ok this is odd because i set "must kill all bosses", put two aquamenti in a boss room, killed one, left and returned, and only one remained
so what rule is it that spawns two if you leave and return

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 08:09

enemies always return screen flag + must kill all bosses
Bosses isn't dungeon boss
it's enemies marked with "doesn't return after death"

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 08:18

ah mm i'll try that then
maybe it's lanmolas fuck with the enemies always return flag, or it combined with that rule...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 08:18

it's very poorly named
Could you layman's terms what you've tried?
this thread makes my head spin a little

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 08:20

so each room has two lanmolas and i leave the room after killing one, and come back. this applies to all test cases
-no rules - 0 lanmolas when i return
-temp no return disabled - 1 lanmola
-temp no return disabled and must kill all bosses - 1 lanmola
-those two rules + boss room - 1 lanmola
now what's left for me to try is the screen flag, plus and minus the must kill all bosses screen rule

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 08:23

okay, so up to this point everything is working fine? (minus the temp no return rule being a stupid name and unclear)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 08:23

(by "disabled", i mean that's the rule name. the rule is checked.)
yup

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 08:23

okay, good
I sometimes find it hard to keep track of what's an issue and what's an observation

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 08:24

honestly might as well move it to NESFix or something? or name it "Fix NES Lanmola and Screen Flag Trap Interactions"
tooltip: "when this rule is off, killing one enemy in a room with lanmolas or the corner traps flag, leaving, and coming back (unless you leave the level and come back) will kill them all. recommended to turn on"
not sure about phrasing since they're "already dead" when you come back, you don't see them explode or anything
but it opens shutters, enables blocks, spawns item yadda yadda
also it might be BOTH of the nes trap screen flags idk

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 08:27

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "okay so here's phantom menace…"): ah seems its both zelda 1 trap screen flags yes (corners and center)
the rule and this help text was made before trap-spawning combo flags existed, and you could place traps as enemies. the screen data was the only way to spawn traps at all.
(sorry for all the edits to the rule name/tooltip)

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:15

If I place a chest combo on a layer, it won't open if the combo underneath it doesn't have the effect square set. Dunno if this is intended or not but it seems to me like the chest should be referencing its own effect square to determine which parts are the chest. Especially when I might happen to be making new floor types in an older tileset resulting in combos without the square checked

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 00:28

```in an older tileset```
shouldn't zq import effect squares correctly? a water combo should have all four quadrants checked automatically

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:34

Could be with how ZQuest does or did interpret old files
I know I started the quest after effect squares were added, but all my unused combos have the effect square as blank.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 00:35

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) are unused combos meant to have full or empty effect squares

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/31/2021 00:35

full

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 00:35

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/31/2021 00:35

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:35

But the quest was saved before that was fixed IIRC

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/31/2021 00:35

ah, yeah, makes sense

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:36

or perhaps not? Try and see on a fresh tileset if it sets it for unused combos

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 00:36

ok so do me a favour, import DOR's original quest now and see what happens to the unused combos

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:37

Yup, as of this version it updates the effect squares properly on older quests
So it's just that my quest was saved in 2.55 prior that it doesn't have that

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 00:37

ok good
no issue

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:38

Still, the original issue. Are effect squares intended to only work on layer 0?
Or to be inherited from 0 on higher layers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2021 03:09

It should be checking on the layer
Guessing that's a bug with the new chest code
Check signs too, they probably have the same issue

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/31/2021 14:43

unless the code's just been horribly broken this whole time

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/01/2021 00:40

yeah the code's just been broken for layered effect squares
layers 1 and 2 always checked the layer below

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/07/2021 14:11

So, first...are Layer 1 and 2 chests rule based?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/07/2021 14:13

You might start to see why I did not rush into layer 1/2 chests and blocks. I may have not elaborated my reasons, as the I am tired of doing that, but I put stuff like that on hold for 2.60 b Ed cause it just adds to beta phase 2.55 fixes.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/01/2021 15:11

Link`s awakening Goombas...

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 02:27

i thought the dropset ID was modifiable via script, and the enemy could detect with what weapon it was being damaged
so if it was damaged with stomp boots and hp = 0 change dropset

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 02:30

i think also with NPC scripts it runs for one frame after the enemy gets killed. So if you want to make a stomp effect you just can, nothing like ghost/Newbie Boss where it has to exist at 1 HP to show the death animation
Though I know the walker is currently ghosted

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:06

I suppose this is possible, but it would need an alt droplet field in guydata
And some funky stuff in the enemy hit resolution code
Thankfully I did add *wpn to that in the past
But you need to use the resolved wpn type after factoring in simulated weapon types
I.e. overrides
So this would require allowing stomp type for non stomp wpns
But it should be quite feasible
Then again
A five line npc script solves it
switch(this->HitBy)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:11

Case wStomp: itm hrt = CreateItem(this-X,this-Y, I_HEART)
Set hrt flags to a drop item
There is a more abstract case for frozen enemies or enemies destroyed by fire.
But those do not yet exist, so for sideview goombas, a script is a decent stopgap

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:14

You may also be able to write this-DropSet based on this->HitBy
Idk if the killl system timing will be happy with that.

Something similar to the "Draining Rupees Can Still Be Spent" rule being off, where if you continue or save and quit while the door repair is draining your rupees, it will subtract the full amount automatically.

granted, it is usually used when the player can't kill the like like before that timer expires, but it's still a case
and at the very least should be a separate QR from draining rupees
(not that i really desire it as a rule)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 13:59

Wo if you want to allow r/w a qr or instr qr should be added with a precaution that basic system timing can override them or timing could override scrolling qnd warps causing softlocks or even crashes.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:00

My general theory is that you could just write x and y and until EntryX and EntryY were proven safe to write or were protected by a rule, not to allow writing them.
There are a number of additions where I felt writing may be unsafe so I waited on that.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:01

they can't be proven safe to write without allowing them to be written to

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:02

If not enabled, ignore writing to them

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:02

if they are unsafe, a QR to enable them can be added after the fact.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:02

You can make it a default on rule
But it is a trivial to add safeguard
I'd wait for Emily to rule on this one ere merging

I apparently did a setEntryX an setEntryY

as part of Screen->
Not sure why at this point.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:50

So if writing to the is not working, it is probably due to the exact sorts of system events that I mentioned worrying about
```case SCREENDATAENTRYX:         
        {
            int newx = vbound((value/10000),0,255);
            tmpscr->entry_x = newx;
            if ( get_bit(quest_rules, qr_WRITE_ENTRYPOINTS_AFFECTS_HEROCLASS) )
            {
                Link.entry_x = (zfix)(newx);
            }
            
        }
        case SCREENDATAENTRYY:         
        {
            
            int newy = vbound((value/10000),0,175);
            tmpscr->entry_y = newy;
            if ( get_bit(quest_rules, qr_WRITE_ENTRYPOINTS_AFFECTS_HEROCLASS) )
            {
                Link.entry_y = (zfix)(newy);
            }
            break;    //B
        }```
and there is already a QR
In instruction rules
@ Moosh
So all the stuff I said should be done has been in place as I discussed for some tie
You probably just need to enable the rule.
My senile mind forgot that I already did it all
the rule is

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 13:53

Oh! Well that's sure hidden away. I assumed instruction rules would all default to whatever makes sense. I'm also still not clear on why it's a rule...
But thanks for pointing it out

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:54

Writing Screen->EntryX EntryY Resets Entry Spawn Points
and it s enabled by default n new quests as I had also said that it should be

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 13:55

Huh

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:55

Because I was unsure what bugs could occur if you do it and wanted a safeguard.

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 13:55

I know this quest was loaded more recently than whenever you added that

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:55

```//Alpha 85

Default new rule on in new quests or on Pick Ruleset.
Fix position of new Instruction Rule in Dialogue
Added a script quest instruction setting to cause Link's respawn
    points to match script-written EntryX and EntryY for Screen->Entry*.
Fixed the bug where Link's spin attack animation is mused when he falls
    into pits if he is holding a charged sword.
    ( ZoriaRPG, 12th November, 2020 )```

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 13:56

But it does indeed default to set on a new quest. So gotta be something about loading a tileset

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:57

tilesets use whatever rules the tileset used when it was saved in whatever version it was last saved
that is normal
using Pick Ruleset will allow you to instantly convert to the `Modern` ruleset
otherwise they use legacy rules and may use version flags

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 13:58

Right, but this being a script related rule, and tilesets not having any scripts in them, would it not make sense for it to default to on?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:58

to set rules that you do not want
it was saved before those existed
it is a .qst file

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 14:00

...Oh. I think I'm just getting mixed up how this works because some of these rule bits have inverted checkboxes 🤦

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 14:01

if a tileset was made in 2.10, and you open it in the latest nightly where 2.10 quests flag all windrobes in 2.10 quests to use the bugged movement, zq will flag the enemies as if it were any other 2.10 quest
inverted?

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 14:01

Like all these default to checked but it's not because ZQuest recognizes the quest format version and updates the ruleset to enable fixes, it's because they're all worded as "don't do thing"

=== @ Moosh 11/02/2021 10:35

Next in the line of bugs caused by naming FFC scripts goofy things that are too long, it appears the tooltip for hovering over it can cause a crash. Script name was `AllTheseFeaturesAndIStillHaveToCodeMovingPlatformsMyself`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2021 10:42

A fucking *TOOLTIP* crash? Uuuhhg

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:59

char buffer for display overflow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:07

So, turns out this uses *local buffer arrays* for the thing, different for each thing that calls tooltips....
....I'm curious what the limit is on script names.
.......if there is one.....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:10

...so, uh, fun times, I don't think script names have a limit on length

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:13

setting it up to use `zc_malloc` to create a buffer of variable size, so it allocates exactly what it needs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:20

. . . . well THERE'S an issue
I just made a script with an absurdly long name
and it just crashed on compile

bleah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:34

ok, so the crash on long name on compile is an `al_trace` somewhere...
....and on fixing that, it crashes again one step later in compile.....

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:35

how about truncating scriptnaes on comp to 255chars?
thatca be an OS limit
orienaes
so why not here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:50

....so it turns out `_jwin_draw_abclistbox` has a fatal error handling long strings
It is supposed to cap and read only the first 1023 characters, but.... the array was uninitialized, so the `[1023]` index was not guaranteed to be a nullchar.....

so that's 5 fucking separate crashes from this one thing

guessing the dropdown has a similar crash to the abclister

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 16:13

ah, and while I fixed the buffer crash for the tooltip
it also has a *separate* crash if the tooltip is wider than the screen

....err, wider than the tooltip bitmap, which is not as wide as the screen

Older versions of Armageddon Quest are broken because they have a bunch of invincible ghinis with a lanmola as the kill all enemy

Yeah I was gonna report this but needed to make some comparison videos. I'll do it later

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 21:11

okay this seems pretty simple
lanmolas just handle their deaths differently

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 22:28

i wonder, should we test this on all the other multi-enemy enemies?
moldorm, manhandla, patra, and... gleeok?
(as for batrobes/summoners i know those work as ringleaders, at least in 2.50.2)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/07/2021 14:04

Lanmolas have never been ringleaders
In theory the income value might help here
But ringleaders tended to be Z1 quests and lqnmolas have never been such
This coupled with the lanmola death bug rule makes them somewhat unsuitable

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/07/2021 15:08

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "Lanmolas have never been ring…"): demonstrably false.
You can literally open up 2.10 and test this.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/07/2021 15:09

Either way, this was because lanmolas got a bit of a rewrite in 2.50, presumably to make them less buggy with the enemy editor

=== @ P-Tux7 11/07/2021 15:14

one quest already used them for that purpose - armageddon quest

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/07/2021 15:40

Oh? As did that?
Well, you can apply it to the core enemy.
And the .10 src exists to use as a point of comparison.

we seem to already know how to handle this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/08/2021 00:54

Okay I'm actually tearing my hair out
I have the source code for both 2.55 and 1.92 open
I'm trying to understand just what exactly changed to disallow lanmolas to be ringleaders

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/08/2021 00:57

the thing where it's stopped is that "dying" is never set as true for the main enemy, it handles it's own death on it's own

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/08/2021 01:11

1.92 also checks for dying, and the only time dying is set is if hp <= 0

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/08/2021 15:55

Okay, figured it out, and it's absurdly dumb
In old versions, the handler enemy set it's own id to something else in the initializer

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/08/2021 15:56

So when the check to grab the first enemy of that id and assign it the ringleader value happens, it would grab the first segment of the lanmola

Found this code in the ZC source. This seems to imply that if Aquamentuses were capable of being set to have 5-Shots, they'd shoot them just fine, which is what I'm requesting to be added. All it probably needs is the option added

I'm not so sure about Gohmas and Gleeoks, but it'd be nice for them too if it doesn't take any extra code except adding those shot types to the list
Please enable 3-Shot and 5-Shot for all 3 of those classes in the next nightly and I'll test them to see if anything breaks.

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "and whenever a hookshot post…"): Oh goddamnit, I know what this is. The diagonal hookshot change made it so that Dir is no longer checked when checking your position relative to the hookshot
and it's just a simple if position is greater than hookshot head or position less then hookshot head

## Multiple placed Enemy0-9 flags of the same ID - spawn on random of flagged spots. (#1005)

=== @ Alucard648 11/05/2021 06:12

For instance, if you place multiple Enemy0 flags (ID37) on the same screen, the 1st enemy in list will chose one of flagged spots at random to spawn upon  screen entry. This will make at least usable to place multiple flags for same enemy slot in list. As for now only first such flag is used, regardless of others.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 17:28

I was thinking that it would be really nice to have a new animation style for Gohmas, like for Elvis' Mothula. Here's how it would work
Row 1: Closed eye
Row 2: Opening eye
Row 3: Opened eye
Each row with 4 frames. And the vulnerable part is auto-calculated based upon the Gohma enemy's tile width, the middle 16 pixels.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 17:29

This allows to have animated eyes, and for the leg frames to be different between rows.

## 💊🔓Flying Enemies Get Stuck at Bottom of Screen (#1007)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/06/2021 21:02

A bug that has supposedly been around awhile that I've looked deeper into recently. It appears that Flying-movement enemies can get stuck on the bottom of screens in the 2.55 builds.
The best example are Bats, though I've seen Digdogger Kids, Keese with increased step speed, and even Manhandla's lacking 3 heads do this.
It seems more common the faster the enemy moves, possibly a rounding error in the movement code?
I made a test quest in 2.52 (to confirm this movement bug was introduced later on).
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/906649822998724690/906650375950577734/FlyingTest.qst
Interestingly, they respect No-Enemy flags and NES dungeon walls.
Slower enemies do not appear to be capable of getting stuck, though surprisingly unmodified Peahats can get stuck.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 21:06

This came about during a rewrite of enemy collision
and it's a fucking mess

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/06/2021 21:06

Also, on the starting screen, notice how there are No Enemy flags matching the cliffs on the bottom. When they get stuck, they suddenly start moving back and forth on the bottom, ignoring said flags.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 21:06

....but the same rewrite that caused this issue also is what allows larger than 1x1 enemies to work, like, at all
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
if you want to try this headache........

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/06/2021 21:07

Best guess, this is just a rounding issue when calculating some sort of "can move" with screen bottoms and higher step speeds.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 21:08

Thank you for rebringing this up
I've been meaning to kill this dead but the report was lost in the old dev server

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/06/2021 21:09

Now, I have been attempting to reproduce a similar looking bug where Bats have a similar "stuck" issue with south-side NES dungeon walls. I saw this behavior while testing a quest for NightmareJames.
They did not stay stuck as long, but also were clearly moving exactly horizontally along the wall for an extended period, something that should be too rare to ever encounter, let alone multiple times.
So, there is a small chance this bug does apply to NES dungeon walls the same way it applies to open screen bottoms.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 22:29

i recall it definitely happened a year ago with moldorms as well
gleeok heads, peahats, and phantoms probably do it too

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 02:14

Besides keeping this relevant and not archived quite yet, I have noticed Bats and Digdogger Kids getting stuck on south NES dungeon walls in one of Nightmare James's quests. Although they don't seem to stay stuck as long, both enemies are clearly moving horizontally along the wall longer than should be plausible. I was unable to replicate this in the test quest though.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 02:52

Okay, figured it out. In my test quest, dungeon walls have the "No Flying Enemy" combo type, while in James's quest, the walls are the "None" combo type. When I replace a south wall in my NES dungeon screens with other solid combos that don't have the "No Flying Enemy" combo type, the rules of NES dungeon enemy movement does lead to flying enemies getting stuck on the south "wall" on occasion.
This means both "No Enemy" flags and "No Flying Enemy" combo interactions are correct, while screen bottoms and the invisible NES dungeon bottom wall have the issue.

I think I fixed it, but I'm confused as to why the bug happened now when it didn't before

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 17:08

i thought speculation was the addition of enemy size changing messed something up?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 21:24

the problem was that diagonal upleft and diagonal upright were both returning false when on the bottom row but not left/right

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 21:30

and bat enemies always change direction to either of the two nearby directions; left means it's only options are upleft and downleft
exception is when they hit a wall which is why they can escape

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/23/2021 21:31

I assume all the enemies I saw reacting to the bug used this same movement code.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/09/2021 03:07

If a folder that's the same name as your quest is in the same folder as your quest, there would be a button in the Compile ZScript dialog that "auto-imports" every script file in that folder and auto-compiles them as a global header. This doesn't happen upon LOADING or RELOADING the quest - you have to press the button every time you want to import from that folder. Might be worth having an "are you sure?" box.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/09/2021 03:09

Since you have to import all of them every time you compile, this would allow questmakers a neat place to keep track of them, especially if the scripts got updates. Some people have also expressed confusion about writing headers, and this would do it for them.

Ok so the red/fiery Gleeok heads block all projectiles on the NES, similar to a Darknut's front. This includes
-Sword Beams
-Boomerangs
-Arrows (makes tink sprite too)
-Wand magic (produces fire too, if Book is had)
Not sure if this would be a bug report or feature request, considering that it involves adding a new Gleeok attribute and QR, but it's technically a bug compared to NES Zelda.
Not to mention that the... possible usage of Gleeok heads to spawn Book fire is fascinating
I can provide video proof if needed. Have a savestate

I would suggest making this an enemy rule.  This would break compatibility in certain quests
But interesting note

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 19:59

yeah the way (most?) enemy qrs work is that they turn on enemy rules
like dodongo cset 8->cset dodongo/digdogger fix is just telling the zc player to make dodongos cset dodongo/digdogger instead of 8
or rope 2s don't flash tells the zc player to turn flashing off for rope 2s and set the cset to 8 (9 in older versions, which is a compatibility issue)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 20:02

bugfixes generally don't mess with extant quests; even in 2.50.2, which had a lot of bugfixes that messed with extant quests, it still kept 1.84/1.90 quest dodongos as cset 8 instead of cset dodongo/digdogger
so that they'd look like what they did to the questmaker and in the 1.84/1.90 zc players
and for instance if side tektites can be bugfixed it'll probably be a rule as well, and extant quests will still have boomeranging tektites

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 20:05

Ok, so I PERSONALLY don't care about this, but it turns out that in NES Z1 the sounds made are
1. Every frame while the weapon is colliding with the head
2. Use the "enemy death" sound instead of the "tink" sound

I guess this is because of that behaviour where, similar to Dungeon Man/Goriya, Manhandla cores and Patra cores when invincible, the Fiery Gleeok Head is not actually invincible. It is just resurrected every frame if it "shouldn't" be dead.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/14/2022 21:30

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908056918155722762/908056974690766878/zc_screen00001.png)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 18:15

If the DMap Offset is flush against the left column of the map (dungeon 0, 0 is also map 0, 0), it displays correctly. In this screenshot, the DMap Offset is -1 (dungeon 0, 0 is map -1, 0)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 18:34

uhhh
check compat rules for something mentioning `charting` or `charted`
and see how that affects it

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 18:39

I will, but also note this was a quest last updated in an older version, so by default it has this bugged behavior when played in recent builds.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 18:41

"Dungeon DMaps Use Classic Charting" is toggled on by default.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 18:42

...ok, that's the right setting, so there's a bug

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 18:42

Yeah, toggling it off and re-entering that dungeon did not change anything with the character map.
~~not my weirdest autocorrect~~
I noticed this too when James was playing through my 4th entry, and it had to have been saved in a recent version to have additions like the Whistle removing Jinxes.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/11/2021 15:40

Definitely noting this.  Kept quiet because didn't know what was causing it

=== @ NightmareJames 11/13/2021 19:41

We definitely need to get to the bottom of this.  Now that I actually got a half hour to concentrate, is this being caused by offsets on the slider in the dmap, or something else?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 22:32

it only breaks with negative offsets
which is probably why this wasn't caught sooner

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 22:57

fixed
weird fucking math shenanigans

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 22:59

basically, the problem is
when you have a negative offset
it has less than 8 screens per row to check
but the way the math was working
it always checked 8 screens
so it weirdly bled some screens from the next row into it
and offset fucking everything
making a giant fucking mess

=== @ NightmareJames 11/14/2021 23:00

I'll test it later tonight or tomorrow

uh, whoops
got distracted while typing that
...though in fairness the tooltips weren't supposed to be out yet
I didn't mean to push them to the main branch
Wait, that's odd
it's typed out in the code...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 00:09

Post the code block?

....hmm
Maybe you fixed it after you pushed?
If not, then something in the gui code is being buggy, which would suck....

first just try retyping it up to see if you accidentally formatted it wrong

i am also unsure about whether this replaces the combo flagged with secrets->next's inherent flag or placed flag when secrets happen

or if it cleverly replaces whichever flag of the two is secrets->next

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/20/2021 23:19

the placed flag
the same way every other flag set in secret combos works

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "lantern class action tab"): ?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 05:53

I'm not sure why that's being cut off

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 05:57

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "?"): no space
and i think the standard is "Activation
Sound"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2021 05:58

Lantern is literally *using the default*
it has `NULL` for it's specific name for that field
also the lack of space was intentional, as it's `itemdata->UseSound` in ZScript
similarly to the other default names like `Attributes[0]`, being the ZScript access for that field

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 05:59

oh does that mean the lens needs to be changed to this instead?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 05:59

to be fair, I'm not sure P-Tux knew that it was shared for all classes
wait what

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2021 05:59

the lens presumably has a specific name
the lantern has the default
as it doesn't actually use that field
you can't *use* a lantern, so the sfx field is not used by the engine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2021 06:01

for reference
```cpp
ItemNameInfo defInfo =
{
    -1, "Power:", "Attributes[0]:", "Attributes[1]:", "Attributes[2]:",
    "Attributes[3]:", "Attributes[4]:","Attributes[5]:","Attributes[6]:",
    "Attributes[7]:","Attributes[8]:","Attributes[9]:", "Flags[0]",
    "Flags[1]", "Flags[2]", "Flags[3]", "Flags[4]", "Sprites[0]:",
    "Sprites[1]:","Sprites[2]:","Sprites[3]:","Sprites[4]:","Sprites[5]:",
    "Sprites[6]:","Sprites[7]:","Sprites[8]:","Sprites[9]:","UseSound",
    "Flags[5]", "Flags[6]", "Flags[7]", "Flags[8]", "Flags[9]", "Flags[10]",
    "Flags[11]","Flags[12]","Flags[13]", "Flags[14]","Constant Script"
};```
This is the default names array

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908133462572146750/912583950990467072/unknown.png)
with plenty of things using a specific name for it, usually if they actually make use of the field

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 06:04

thanks!

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:45

ok so what the fuck
apparently you can assign a flag to any Room Secret Combo Type (and flags 16-31 ones etc.) by ctrl+clicking on it
this definitely needs to be added to the gui
oh so THAT'S what people used to make torches that you had to activate one after the other

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:46

That's tiered secrets
literally the definition of tiered secrets

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:47

yeah i know but i thought you had to use inherent combo flags for that
instead this auto-places them when the Secret Combo appears

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:48

this isn't at all new
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the same way every other flag…"): ^

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:48

i know but it needs either a reminder on the secret combos screens
or just prompt which flag to use after the user selects each secret combo
(it defaulting to 0 [None] of course)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:49

something to keep in mind when that gui is rewritten

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:50

you added the convert water to non-solid dialog to the ruleset picking process didn't you?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:51

It used to do it without asking
I made it ask

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2021 16:35

@ P-Tux7 now that they're done
if you find any bugs or anything with QR help text, please lemme know

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 17:34

thanks!

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 02:59

ah this was it
so i think for the rule where burn flags are triggered instantly
it says that wand magic can trigger them if on, right
however it should say that "if the player has the book, wand magic will trigger burn flags as it passes over them"

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 03:01

oh dear um
so check either of those two menus
select an item class

the selected class will scroll, but the list of items on the right will not change

```cpp
map<int32_t, map<int32_t, vector<int32_t> > > families;```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2022 04:03

(Laymans terms, this reads:
`Map: For each int (itemclass ID), *optionally* store a...`
`Map: For each int (item level), *optionally* store a...`
`Vector: List of item IDs`)
So for each itemclass, it stores a map which, for each item level of that itemclass, stores all the items of that level
...then it iterates through the map in the map's order, populating the dialog
so, for each family, iterate through each level; for each level, iterate through each item ID
ergo, by family first, level second, and ID last for sorting. Fun!

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 01:32

um

this is technically a readme thing but...
above the list of hotkeys in zquest.txt can it please be added that some shortcuts may require usage of the numpad keys with num lock on to use them on laptop keyboards?
y'know, like there's two asterisks on the keyboard, but only the numpad one works
(the list below 2.2 BASIC COMMANDS in zquest.txt)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2022 02:05

Ideally such issues could be fixed
though, like, allegro bullshit
...immediate question though, you leave numlock off ever?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 02:06

this is gonna sound really silly but yeah because if num lock is on there's this little light on the num lock key

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2022 02:07

If that light isn't on my keyboard I know something is wrong

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 02:07

oh, you've gotten used to it? very well then, i can give it a try

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2022 02:07

having that off is physically painful to me
I have not had numlock off in like
since I first touched a computer
so like 2 decades

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2022 05:20

like I said, `as long as you're careful with it`
I think I did the combo type help text for link stuff
and, it was a fun time making sure I didn't fuck anything up....
Also keep in mind you can find *in selection*
so you can highlight just a section of text and replace only within that section

=== @ P-Tux7 01/07/2022 05:21

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2022 05:22

also, you could do `Link` -> `the Player`; but don't use `Replace All`
instead hit `find` to look at each one
and then `replace` for each one that should be changed
letting you manually check each one, while still being much faster than *completely* manual

=== @ P-Tux7 01/07/2022 05:22

what text editor is that in?

notepad++
I pretty much never use anything else
it's way too good
anyway, adding this for no mirroring:`"While touching this flag, attempting to use a Mirror item will fail."`
pushed that
feel free to change if you like
Also, now just imagine us going through THIS https://www.zeldaclassic.com/zscript-docs/

did i report that the defense classes in the item tab's weapon tab for item spoofing say "script 1-10" when it should be "custom 1-10"

The Ganon class has a new behaviour flag that allows the amulet to affect the enemy if the owned amulet is L2 or higher.

## Rename Script LWeapons 1-10 to Custom or General-Purpose (#1015)
@ P-Tux7 opened this issue on 11/10/2021

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:23

Since they can be used to hurt enemies or trigger combos without scripts by setting an existing item to use their defense, these "Scripted LWeapons" should be renamed to show that they can be used without scripting. New users intimidated by scripting may not realize this without the name change.
This affects the following dialogs, to my knowledge
-Item Defense
-Enemy Defenses
-Combos - Triggered By...

these flags appear to be wrong
`ENEMY_FLAG1` is being checked for `Attributes 13`, despite that being flag 2 in the editor

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908184341874606101/908184498410229800/unknown.png)
and this is the special flags for Ganon
which.... ***all of the related code for this flag is commented out and does not exist in builds***
What the fucking hell
This needs to be fixed, and the flag for amulet 2+ showing ganon needs to be implemented+checked by default

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:24

does enemy is completely invisible cloak them or just plain not draw them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:24

should be not draw

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2021 23:05

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/19/2021 23:05

great question

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2021 23:05

Reminder that ganons tile chanes every frame to a random tile

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/19/2021 23:05

perhaps check the commented out code to see if there was an idea there
if not, perhaps come up with something new

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2021 23:05

Just showing ganon all the time is a lazy copout
Maybe he shows every x frames?
You get a better gist of where he is, but not a perfect one

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 00:29

cloaked ganon?
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Reminder that ganons tile cha…"): oh yeah, more ganon bs
zelda classic has 5 frames
but zelda 1 seems to have him go through *6* frames in order, one per frame, and the one displayed when you hurt him is said frame that he's currently on
it's a little hard for me to tell if the 6th frame is a real thing or not because i've only seen it using the Buffet speedrun test rom's visible ganon option... not on unmodified Z1

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 00:33

also i wasn't sure whether to say this the other day
and keep in mind i think it was through the zoria or tamamo grapevine
but i heard there were meant to be two "classes" of invisible enemies
1. cloaked
2. invisible (1.90, 2.50 enemy is completely invsible)
amulet 1 makes cloaked enemies visible and invisible enemies cloaked
amulet 2 makes all enemies visible
i, as said before, was unsure to mention this
because i am not sure if it was ever an intended idea
and to be frank, completely invisible enemies as a gameplay mechanic are awful and should not have dev time spent on them
(though rendering cloaked enemies as invisible DOES need to be added for 1.90 compatibility, I'll go post in that thread and remind myself to check if their projectiles are invisible too tomorrow)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 01:38

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "and to be frank, completely i…"): Didnt stop zoria from wasting attributes on that exact feature

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 01:40

i thought enemy was completely invisible was a 2.50.2 thing
or did he add more

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 19:31

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "zelda classic has 5 frames"): oh duh i'm an idiot
does it have him have 6 frames and the 6th is just a flipped version of one of the others
like so many pre-new enemy tiles things worked

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 20:14

ye

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 20:21

whew

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:39

i think the best way to handle this would have settings in the amulet 2 item itself
1. How Often To Show Ganon
2. How Long Each Showing Lasts
and it might need a bit of touchup with the ganon animation code so every appearance of ganon isn't animating and stays on one static frame
...or you could just have the "appearances" be their own decoration/sparkle, spawned where ganon is, and have them NOT move with him

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:42

i could PROBABLY rustle up 4-way walking Ganon sprites (not in time for the alpha but for the tileset) but i have no idea how you'd set the animation for those
(they'd use the "special" tile or just be on the row below Z1 Ganon)
okay so, kooky idea, but QR where a Ganon enemy is hardcoded to use the Ganon animation while invisible, and uses the user-defined one while visible

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:46

or enemy flag, whatever, and make all quests in the player below A100 (or A101) turn that flag off

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:52

maybe yeah

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 00:40

oh and the first z1 frame should probably always be used for when he's hurt while visible

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 21:22

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) #1050 had a great idea for what an amulet 2 can do to modern ganon

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/21/2021 21:24

yeah?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 21:24

Can you test to see if Ganon and enemies work with invisibility options and havign specific items toggle visibility for enemies?
I think it works, but I lack self confidence

also while we're at it i was modifying ganon and
flags -> behaviour -> use editor???
and "death shot item ID"?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:54

Death shot item ID is, I think, an attempt to have silver arrows but for any item type?

i'll try it out later in #deleted-channel

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:56

oh and uh, one last thing, how do i set enemies to be invisible (the kind that can be dispelled)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:56

Oh, @ P-Tux7 don't bother

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:56

i thought you could make enemies individually invisible and not just the screen flag

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:56

it's not implemented
entire code is commented out and does nothing

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:56

well that's handy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:56

lmfao
the ganon deaht shot and use editor stuff, I mean

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:57

yeah i would have thought it'd be Lweapon type + Lweapon level instead of just one number to enter

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:57

Use Editor is supposed to let you define custom defense values for ganon
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i thought you could make enem…"): Should be one of the 3 flag tabs of the enemy editor

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:57

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Use Editor is supposed to let…"): ok that'd admittedly be neat but i don't have any plans in mind for it right now
oh so i want "enemy is completely invisible" + "draw enemy as cloaked" to simulate the screen flag effect?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:59

I think so, yeah
Draw Invisible as Cloaked

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:59

## Options for More Readable Custom Item Classes (#1017)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/11/2021 21:27

At the moment, all custom item classes are simply called "zzNumber", which appears to start at 67. This can be difficult to keep track of what each custom class is for when creating custom items or setting up subscreens.
An ideal solution would be the ability to rename each of these item classes on a quest per quest basis, though it has been pointed out this would increase quest sizes and be a lot of work to set up.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/11/2021 21:32

One other (I admit silly) consideration is a zQuest compatibility option that when enabled, displays classes zz067 - zz 086 as "Custom Item Class Number" like it used to be, for those who preferred that method (plus older quests might have specifically used those item classes because of those identifiers, and would be confused by them being grouped with all the other zz classes now.

it's very fucking confused about how to draw the title screen
and uhhh
nothing to do with the title screen drawing has changed in *almost 2 years*
so, what the fuck has decided to cause this now, is a great question
it's pulling the tiles from the most recently loaded quest, instead of from the qst.dat quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 11:11

.......so, this change appears to be an issue with the new `qst.dat`
going back a number of builds the issue persisted
but reverting to the old *module* fixed the issue
what the ever-living fuck could cause this
this has probably been broken for *years* on the engine side, just waiting for a module to fuck everything up
and, nothing related to the title screen settings in the module has changed in any way.....
Proposed fix: Revert the title screen to not use modules anymore. This means scavenging for the old code from *years* ago
FML
not tonight's job
@ Moosh @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) figure you might care to be in this thread

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 11:15

Kinda hilarious that modules went relatively unused for so long that something like this apparently slipped by

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 11:15

again, *nothing related to the title screen changed*
even in the module update
so, I still have absolutely no clue what's causing it
also, the fact that it's reading tiles from DoR when I load your quest is severely worrying
as it should be reading the tiles from qst.dat
and it clearly isn't
so there might be *multiple* issues here
but, the module is the clear and obvious first issue
Frankly at this rate, I feel like slowly reverting everything to do with modules is the right way to go
taking things like itemclass names and making those per-quest editable
and just removing things like title screen and sfx.dat
....probably leave modules as just quest progression chains
because that part seems quite solid and useful

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/13/2021 11:21

(replying to @ Moosh "Kinda hilarious that modules…"): idea doomed to failure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 21:15

.....hmm
So, actually digging into this, I have no fucking idea what's actually causing it not to load properly
because it looks like it should
but, regardless, frankly, the title screen shouldn't be *reliant* on qst.dat
it literally *only uses the blue frame*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 22:17

I want to fucking rip my hair out
what the fuck
is wrong with this
thus far I've gotten crashes... where the debugger specifies that it's an allegro file that it can't give me any information on
but when I breakpoint to try to find where it crashes.... it just doesn't crash
and now I'm trying to fix the blue frame
but instead I get literally the entire fucking screen being a solid gray
like what the fuck

ooo-kay
got it back to this
something is *seriously* fucked up with how ZC is reading qst.dat
which, it tries to load *only certain parts of the quest file*, rather than loading it all at once

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 22:46

something to do with that system is clearly broken for new quests
so now I just have it loading the whole qst.dat each time
which might increase load times on the title screen, but hopefully not by much

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 23:19

Perhaps a dumb question, but why does the title screen rely on the quest format just to access graphics? Could it not just use a .dat with only title and menu graphics, or just package the menu graphics in the .exe?

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 23:21

Even for back in the 1.90 days the way this menu is being handled seems exceptionally silly. The only graphics that should need to be loaded from .qst files is the menu icons, and that's seemingly the only part that didn't break

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 23:24

Fuck if I know
The blue frame now is not loading from that anymore, notice that it doesn't have rounded corners
I just made it a blue rect
but, the entire fucking *palette* is loaded from the qst.dat
which is why it was grey blob before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 23:28

(game icons have their own palette)
(which is why they weren't broken)

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 23:28

Could they not have just loaded the main part of the palette from an array? Also does the 4th quest password load from a different quest or just hardcode change colors?
assuming the latter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 23:30

```cpp
loadpalset(0,red ? pSprite(spPILE) : 0);```
it loads a sprite palette from the same quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 23:42

I am so confused

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909032712990511175/909226749911527444/unknown.png)
the life meter is just that
and I don't know why
according to it, it's drawing the correct tile, in the correct cset
but then it just isn't

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 23:50

what the fuck color even *is* that?
it isn't in the palette that I can see

those load into special palette rows

Pretty simple, draw a polygon to the screen, give it more points than the supplied array allows, ZC hangs and becomes unresponsive

...........fucking really?
wow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 20:55

oh

so, uh,
it just passes the arguments directly to allegro's `polygon`
and.... allegro's polygon doesn't like giving it more points than the array

@ Moosh see if this fixes it
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909036728688476161/909187312569704458/zelda.exe
it should, if you give more points than the array holds, reduce the points to what the array holds
so if you give a `[6]` array, but pass `4` for numpoints, it'll pretend you passed `3` instead, as that's the most that fits
also, it'll now do nothing if you give it 0 or negative number of points
given that I saw no sanity check on that either

If the player owns a candle item with this flag, NES dark rooms no longer darken. This check is performed BEFORE the game darkens the room, so no darken-then-relight animation has to play. I think this was a classic.zh script but would be REALLY great to have.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:57

1. A flag that doesn't auto-hover - you have to press the jump button again while in mid-air. Might be tricky to handle with multi-jumps, sorry.
2. Multi-Use With Multi-Jumps: If checked, you get a new hover for each jump that you get (Roc's Feather multi-jump feature). If not, it only activates once no matter how many times you've jumped.
3. Auto-Hover over Pitfalls - If you have Hover Boots and walk over a pitfall, you auto-hover to stop your fall. I think Ocarina of Time worked like this? It gives similar but more useful functionality to a ladder, even without Roc's Feather. Great for 8-way quests.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:58

So
1. This will be basically impossible thanks to multi-jump
2. This is *sort of* already a thing

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909698486621073439/909698974175363093/unknown.png)
If you hover until it runs out, it won't reset until you land with that checked
though, if you press Down to cancel the hover, then multi-jump, the timer will resume from where you cancelled it
3. Does this not already happen? I thought that's how I implemented pitfalls....

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:59

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:11

The following classes, similar to LTTP or later games, would have options for their projectiles to be blocked by any combo detected as solid. These would run the usual animation when blocked by an enemy, so for example an arrow would have that "tink" thing.
-Arrow (the projectile)
-Boomerang
-Candle (the projectile)
-Cane of Byrna(beam, low priority)
-Din's Fire(this has been postulated to probably not be possible)
-Magic Book (applies to wand fire)
-Sword (the beam)
-Wand (the magic, creates fire if book is owned)
I think Generic Combos have projectile-blocking features, but this would apply to all solid combos, and would check their solidity quadrants.

A request for the Magic Key to be able to set map status, compass status, and boss key status
if you are in a DMap within its currently-existing level range option.

Attributes:
0: Keys
1: Maps
2: Compasses
3. Boss Keys
The Magic Compass can actually be extremely nifty to do a late-game "treasure hunt" in compassless quests - by giving it to you late in the game and telling you to go look in the rooms indicated by the compass in earlier levels.
The Magic Map mostly just serves as a convenience similar to Z1, but it can be used as an "atlas" item if you have custom dungeon map graphics and give it a range of DMaps to work in.

....using attributes for this sounds terrible
and, a "range"? A range would take 2 attributes per

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:24

The Magic Boss Key is inspired by Liberation of Hyrule, where James24 used the Magic Key to allow for certain lock blocks to be used, and to let you skip certain rooms. This would allow for the usage of normal keys in such a situation. It can also be used to unlock various places all across the game world, separate from normal keys.
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and, a "range"? A range would…"): No, it uses the existing Magic Key level range. Basically, you set in an attribute whether it applies to keys, maps, compasses, or boss keys.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:25

oh wait
they already have a level range?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:25

yup

Thinking ahead of a useful feature, there is a curiosity on how Candles set the step speed of the created flames, how hardcoded of a value this is, and if this could be changed so an Attribute of Candle Items is the Step Speed of Candle Flames.
This addition would likely need to include a QR to support current "hardcoded" Candle Flame step speed.
Some advantages to freeing up this hardcoded value is being able to create Candles with no range (sort of like the LttP Lantern flames), or have higher leveled candles shoot flames further.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 12:40

Shouldn't need a QR, it seems
there's nothing fancy hardcoded about the candle
it just sets the step speed to 50 in the constructor
so, instead, it can set it to an attribute
(which will default to 50)

@ likelike on fire in the Active Subscreen (the "revision 2 triforce" one), go to the potion/letter item slot
Make sure it is set to "Letter or Potion (Subscreen only)"
this will make it so letters and potions work as they should work
make sure you do this for every subscreen you are using in the quest

we were very confused back then
However, your quest has magic potions as well. What you want to happen when you use the Level 2 Magic Potion? Do you want to use the Level 2 Magic Potion and have it turn into a Level 1 Magic Potion? When you use that Level 1 Magic Potion, do you want it to turn back into the letter?

1. Do Not Drop Bomb Item When Killed While Stunned by an Explosion - does not drop the 4 bombs item (whatever ID that is) when killed while stunned by explosion smoke
2. Do Not Drop Super Bomb Item When Killed While Stunned by a Super Explosion - same but for super bomb explosions
3. Do Not Auto-Drop Super Bombs If Killed By Eating One - does not drop (default super bomb item #) if it eats one and this depletes its HP and it dies. So you can't "recycle" the one Super Bomb.
4. Use Choking Frames While Stunned - uses the choking frames while stunned by an explosion. Visual indicator to let you know you can hit it

(todo: list whatever IDs 4bombs and super bomb are hardcoded to be)

it might also be worth it to add an option to change its auto-drops by entering an item # instead of them being hardcoded. but that could be costly

ok so apparently the dodongo drops use hardcoded dropset #s

I see you have an Items->Secrets screen flag and I think it would be cool to have an Items->Enemies screen flag where enemies don't appear until you pick up the item on the screen.

=== @ vlamart 11/18/2021 04:35

Seeing that there are all these combinations of screen flags, and maybe it could also be away to consider tiered secrets, by maybe a menu or tab or something organised like:
Event 1 -> Event 2 = screen state 1
Event 3 -> Event 4 = screen state 2
Event 5...
And the events can be a pull-down with item, secret, trigger, enemies, etc., and the screen state can be a check box. So not only could you do Items->Enemies, but also
Items->Enemies [check]
Enemies->Secrets [check]

(forgive me for forgetting to set a secret combo for the bomb-triggered tree, but you'll see it get triggered and disappear in the second quest)
so here we have a tree corner, that when slashed with a sword, should be triggered. it is triggered properly in both quests as you can tell because it goes to the next combo. quest 2 has it be "always triggered". it's triggered there too because it goes to the next combo there too.
but in quest 1, it doesn't trigger any secrets despite triggers secrets being set
but in quest 2 it does trigger all the secrets - secret tiles 0-3 appear, and the bomb and blue candle flags make their respective secret tiles appear
so uh, the idea here is that in quest 1, when manually triggering it, the stuff that happens when it's always triggered in quest 2 should happen

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:06

...wait, is "Triggers Secrets" meaning that triggering that combo should trigger secrets, or that that combo appearing should trigger secrets? it sounds like the first considering always triggering the combo in quest 2 triggers secrets

If you set a Rope-walking Walking Enemy to have a Shot Type of Rapid-Fire, it doesn't actually ever fire... despite that shot type not requiring halting. This QR would allow for that. I think this would make Death Knights a whole lot fairer since you would be able to "bait" them and hit them from the side. If this counts as a bug report then let me know and I'll recreate it there.

An option for Wallmasters to just do damage (and maybe knockback?) like a regular enemy, while still having the cool wallmaster movement.

Bonus points if the wallmasters can shoot weapons.

=== @ Alucard648 11/21/2021 16:13

I would also add WallMaster(warp) that upon grabbing Link will warp him via side warp, like into pit with insta-death spikes.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 23:45

Wallmaster warp should be a 2-bit flag for
0: Z1 behaviour
1: Tile Warp
2: Side Warp
3: ??? (Reserved? maybe a setting of 3 makes it not grab the player at all?)
And a 2-bit flag for which of the tile/side warp to use
0: A
1: B
2: C
3: D
possibly make this as a dropdown instead of entering a number manually

Works the same as the option for Defense Rings, you enter a damage value of 125, and it translates to 125% damage (or +25% damage). The item rule could apply to an existing damage slot, or a new one added.

...except wait, *visiting 0x80* is marking the next map's 0x00 as visited in-engine?
or is your script writing the visited state there for some reason?
because, the bug then is that ST_VISITED is being set for an 0x8\* screen

In ALTTP the default button for swing your sword was the B Button and due to recent updates regarding button mapping, ZC finally has enough buttons to mimic the ALTTP button mapping for those quest aiming to mimic ALTTP. It would be ideal to have the freedom to change the default sword button to B for certain quests, although I can forsee some tweaks being required for certain other QRs.

Flag: Modern Ganon
```honestly if i had to reprogram ganon i'd just do something like "teleports x amount towards link by drawing a straight line to him and moving along that axis, and shoots, does this ad infinitum until hit, then respawns in random-ish location that won't telefrag link a la summonerobe"```
If the flag is used, his Step Speed is how many pixels each teleport takes him closer to Link.

Flag: Hold Up Triforce: On by default. If on, you'll do the intro cutscene thingy.

Flag: Drops Room Special Item: If on, he drops the room's Special Item instead of the Triforce (Whole). This is actually how it worked in Z1 - that was just his room's item.

Flag: Can Be Stun-Locked: If on, you can do that thing from Z1 where he has a few vulnerable frames between getting hurt once and rando-teleporting. If not, he will be invincible during this time, guaranteeing a rando-teleport.

Attribute: Teleports Per Shot: How many teleports he takes, and on the last one shoots, and resets the counter. This means that if you set it to 3, he'd teleport, teleport, teleport+make fireball, repeat. I realized that if he shot one every time he teleported you couldn't get in to hit him.

Attribute: How Many Death Knells: If more than 1, his HP resets once you shoot him (a la Z1 if you DON'T shoot him), one gets added to this counter, and he restarts his pattern. Once this counter is reached, shooting him will actually kill him. It was 4 in LTTP, for example.

Attribute: Death Knell Weapon Type: What you have to shoot him with to add a Death to his counter while stunned. Arrows by default.

Attribute: Minimum Death Knell Weapon Level: 2 by default.

Attribute: Teleports Per Visible: If you have a Ganon-seeing Amulet, every xth teleport will show him, and then he will hide again until the next xth teleport. (maybe a flag for this happening without an amulet as well?)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 21:27

oh yeah, and i have no idea if it's currently hardcoded, but to avoid wasting an attribute let's just say that his stunned cset will be the one after whichever is set for him
so in the ESPs you'd put
-teal ganon
-red ganon
in that order

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/21/2021 21:28

```Flag: Hold Up Triforce: On by default. If on, you'll do the intro cutscene thingy.``` this is tied to the Ganon room type

Oh, it's just come to my attention that Ganon's explosion sprite is hardcoded in the location where it is on tile page 0. So it probably should be his Special Tile or an attribute.

Go right and then left to activate the Ganon fight (Ok, this is actually probably a bug in and of itself, isn't it, that the start room [or continue point?] can't initiate a Ganon fight)
Kill Ganon, pick up Triforce, shutter opens, yadda yadda. Go right and then left again.
Notice that he respawns! However, the shutter opens on its own, and he drops no Triforce, only ashes. Go right and then left again.
No more Ganon!
Of note is that this room is NOT a boss room. So this would be of interest to people who don't want Ganon to be the Dungeon Boss.

Also the third thing that bothers me with this menu is that you can map blocks of tiles to combos but not blocks of combos to aliases. Despite them more often being placed next to each other, you have to assign one at a time
Be nice if the alias editor allowed shift click. Once again I assume hardcode bullshit

I notice you guys are kinda on a roll with new item implementation lately and I think I got one that I think would work great in classic styled quest. The Protect Bell from Terranigma. It would be a passive item that rings when you choose the correct direction in a maze path screen, similar to how it originally worked in Terranigma

Suggestions:
-"Error" sound as well for when the wrong path is picked and the maze resets, similar to Super Mario All-Stars. Does not play when using the "maze exit" (i.e. East in Z1 Lost Woods)
-Flag: Also Play Success Sound When Maze Solved (if set to off, only the screen secret sound plays a la normal Z1. If set to on, the success chime of the item plays in addition to the screen secret sound.)

I would like to have the option to faithfully emulate the behavior of the Mask of Eyes as flags for the Lens of Truth (In YS 1: The Mask of Eyes causes the world to be rendered in grey-scale and hides enemies on screen but still reveals hidden passages and hidden items).

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 11/29/2021 16:36

A very, VERY lazy thing to do to simulate that feature is to create a fully walkable normal boring new combo that looks like a series of extremely visible check-mark shaped colors and such, and put it on a transparent layer of each screen.

When it's time to ship the quest out, all you have to do is go that combo and remove the graphics and animation from it.  The combo will still technically be there on those screens that you know are done, but no one will see it.  If you want to do more work on it, give that combo back its graphics so you'll see that big annoying highly-visible checkmark everywhere on screens you're happy with.

So you know how we've all gotten used to changers being shown by a little flashing pixel in the upper left? That's a little strange isn't it? It can be a little hard to see at times. But also a lot of scripts run off an invisible FFC. It's tradition to hide those in the upper left corner, but it's still easy to lose track of them. So what I'd propose is a checkbox under the View dropdown that makes all FFCs more visible, drawing rectangular hiboxes around them.

Also should maybe be disabled in small mode because there script names actually do fairly frequently cover portions of the screen. Portions where nothing much is happening but still enough for it to get irritating

=== @ P-Tux7 12/04/2021 23:02

This has two components:
1. Killing all beatable enemies in a boss room makes all the non-beatable enemies disappear as well
2. The non-beatable enemies will not spawn when any boss room on the current DMap is entered. This is similar to and in addition to how, currently, beatable enemies do not spawn if the room is a boss room and the boss room cleared flag is true.

This is to allow for boss rooms with hazards like statues, traps, Zoras, and Bubbles, but that do not unfairly kill or jinx the player after the boss dies or should they return to the boss room.

Options for boomerangs to:

=== @ P-Tux7 12/09/2021 03:46

Attributes:
-Is New (flag, tells it to use these new properties)
-What enemy to spawn (0-511)
-Spawn type (Instant, Puff [default Z1 puff], Blink [Armos/Grave Ghini], Use Enemy's Spawn Animation [for if the user, well, set a custom spawn animation that they want it to use])
-Spawn Offset X (-256-255 should be enough for scriptless users)
-Spawn Offset Y
-Requires Screen To Have Shooting Statue Screen Flag To Spawn (as the title says. Most users would want this off for convenience. But it's required for compatibility, and scripters can use it to do a sneaky quick difficulty increase by having the hard difficulty mode set the Statues Shoot screen flag to always be on, and have some statue combos only shoot if that flag is on aka in hard difficulty.)
I was reminded of this with the #deleted-channel discussion. It would be nice to be able to always spawn an enemy in a certain spot when you enter the room so you always have something to switch spots with.
And of course, custom (the default ZC projectile-shooter enemies now as combos) and scripted npc statue combos.

So here's one of those buggy blind spots I recently noticed. When moving FFCs around in the editor, they get caught along the edges of the screen despite being able to be positioned out of bounds. Then when you release it, it gets placed at a random-ass position. So for example, I dragged one off the top of the screen and it got flung to 189, 247. It's like the Y value when being dragged was a byte and it underflowed. Oh fuck that's exactly what's happening isn't it?
Anyways, this is one of those editor quirks I've just sorta gotten used to, but it probably is a bug the more I look at it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 12:55

Pahhahaha yeah that's exactly what's happening
should be fixed (now will bound it within the screen)

A while back I recall Zoria added a bunch of strange functions that drew screen combo data to a bitmap as color data, supposedly for use with scrolling systems. I figured it'd be handy to use this to autogenerate a solidity minimap for something aaaaaaaaaand they don't fucking work at all.
These ones for reference

=== @ Moosh 12/09/2021 10:43

The main one I tried was DrawScreenSolid. It worked for map 29 but arbitrarily not for map 28. I have no idea what map number had to do with it, but 28 did not match that map's solidity map at all. I also tried both the  DrawScreenComboFlags and DrawScreenComboIFlags functions, neither of which seemed to work, once again on map 28

=== @ Moosh 12/09/2021 10:46

...But once again, they seem to work on map 29. So I seem to be narrowing in on some kind of cause

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/09/2021 15:47

@ Moosh got any test quests where the issue exists?

Apparently you have to Free it manually, you can't just treat it like other variables...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:02

@ Moosh okay, so I think I already know the answer
but just gonna ask: did the screens in question where it didn't work have a layer assigned?
and the ones where it did work not have any layers

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:03

Oh yeah, sorry I forgot to get back to you on that earlier

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:05

Believe so yes. Specifically 28 was a game map and 29 was one of its layer maps

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:05

yeah then that's the problem
```DrawScreenComboFlags and DrawScreenComboIFlags functions, neither of which seemed to work, once again on map 28``` I'm weirded out that these are inverted

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:06

So what's going on with this then? Layers on the screen causing some kind of offset on what data it's reading?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:08

the layer draws were basically overwriting the draws of the layer 0 draws

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:09

so layer 1 would just replace whatever layer 0 had drawn with it's own shit, even if there's nothing on layer 1
because the bitmaps weren't being masked

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:09

ohh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 00:10

also, the very way this is set up won't work AT ALL for anything but solidity
all of the flag versions won't work

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:10

That's fucking wacky

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:11

Going to deprecate/rewrite the ones that aren't DrawScreenSolid

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:11

Why would he even use DrawScreen as the basis when writing these instead of DrawLayer 🤦

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 00:11

the problem is, what if position 0 has a flag on layer 0 and layer 1?
it would only show layer 1's
because it COVERS layer 0's
very fun times

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 16:44

Note to self or @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) : check z1 disassembly. These keese are faster than the blue ones on NES

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/11/2021 04:46

Hmm...

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:37

blue keese max speed in the disassembly: 1f = 31
red/cset 9 keese max speed in the disassembly: 7f = 127
considering that the keese step speed in zelda classic is 62, i presume this means it would be 254 or 255
though, death knights only have 150... perhaps keese step speed needs to be recalculated?

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:40

```InitBlueKeese:
    ; Choose one of eight random directions.
    LDA Random, X
    AND #$07
    TAY
    LDA Directions8, Y
    STA ObjDir, X
    JSR ResetFlyerState
    LDA #$C0
    STA FlyingMaxSpeedFrac
    LDA #$1F
    STA Flyer_ObjSpeed, X
    RTS

InitRedOrBlackKeese:
    JSR InitBlueKeese

    ; Red and black keeses are like blue ones, but faster.
    LDA #$7F
    STA Flyer_ObjSpeed, X
    RTS```
that's sure sounding like it's setting the object speeds to be 1f and 7f respectively

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:42

yeah er, moldorms have $80 which would be 128
it's clearly not the same way of calculating step speed here

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:45

ok so $40 is 1 pixel per frame movement it seems

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 02:45

so $40 = 100 step

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 02:46

so take the input value `n`, and do `n / 0.64` to get a zc step speed?
0x7F = `198.4375`, so 198 step
....and `48.4375`, or 48 step, for the blue
I'd probably round those off to 50/200 for simplicity

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:50

```If the darknut is red, then move at q-speed $20 (0.5 pixels a frame).```

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/918906002995314698/919421404259160144/keesespeed.qst
the vire keese are faster but certainly not THAT much more so
i'll ask the randomizer community that has some hackers in it how many pixels per frame flying enemy speed results in

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 03:02

ok so i think what we need to do is
i need to know how many pixels per frame a keese step speed at max acceleration is
or preferably, what step speed would result in 1 pixel per frame
*in ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 03:07

100 = 1px/frame

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 07:22

Oh, so Red/Black Keese START at a higher speed, but have the same max speed as a Blue Keese

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I'd probably round those off…"): IIRC Blue Keese use a specific step speed that has a hardcoded side effect

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2022 05:39

It's a good effort, but it doesn't seem like they're as fast as they are on NES. Why do the red Keese seem faster on NES even though they and the blue ones have the same top speed?!?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 12:00

@ P-Tux7 all it does is start them with their max speed when they spawn
so if they aren't as fast, then that means that their max speed is higher than what the default quest has them as

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 15:41

(it also means that blue keese are also slower than they are in NES)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 15:42

hmm, red keese don't actually start at their max speed

It's mostly just wrangling with the dumb way floater_walk is handled internally to add the features

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 18:41

@ P-Tux7 So I have two attributes, "acceleration step" and "acceleration frame delay"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 18:42

the first is how much step it increases the keese by when accelerating; the second is how many frames between each step increase there are
do you think that's clear, or is there a better way to name these?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2022 18:45

acceleration interval for the latter?
or maybe that for the former and acceleration timer for the latter

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 20:18

I used the one you linked, but reading the assembly is tedious cause I only half understand it
Just to confirm, Keese max speed are 3 pixels per frame, right?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2022 21:20

Uh I'll check once I get home
In the meantime I can give you the tip to set your Level to 4 in Buffet and give yourself a sword to easily test Vires
(Black Keese only show up in the second quest but act the exact same as Vire/Red)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 22:05

@ P-Tux7 there's no way their max speed is 3 pixels per frame
that's way too fast
even with the more gradual speeding up
(I can't check the buffet hack cause I don't have a Z1 emulator set up)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 22:07

I gave them a landing cooldown of 4 seconds

so they won't try to land until after they've been in the air for at least that much time
they also spawn at max speed

I scripted this with a trick
...I used an identifier "lens_on" it initiates a constant input if it's = 1 (by pressing the button once), while pressing the button again sets it back to "0" (and stop constant input)

Also if Start is pressed, or the equiped item is not the lens, or link is falling, or MP is < 1 (etc) ... it's instantly set to "0"
But that's definitly not the best way to do it 🙂 🙂 🙂

It would be helpful in further testing and organising assets if demo/test quests used during development for new features were released either with the Nightly, or packaged separately

=== @ Moosh 12/13/2021 15:00

Packaged separately would be better IMO. Zoria used to package his demos with releases and it just contributed to the thing being unwieldy to download

=== @ vlamart 12/13/2021 15:08

That's smart, maybe in their own thread for those who'd even want them

=== @ P-Tux7 12/13/2021 15:58

it also didn't help that he packaged scripted quests which a lot of users didn't care about or at least couldn't tell how it was any "better" than 2.50

=== @ vlamart 12/13/2021 17:17

Just a simple one or two screen demo of how a new combo/enemy/item is put together during development. But I can see the bloat many of these could cause

Would it be a Weapon Type or a new Sprite Class though?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 22:00

If the former, it could damage enemies that it's pushed into
but then that goes into it being a weapon type that presumably could be created, unless it's given the same restrictions as melee weapons and just isn't allowed to be created

Would the Cane of Somaria be doable by creating a pushblock *on a layer*?
Now, granted, that would require not having layer 1/2 combos in spots where you can place or push a block - but you already have to make similar considerations when using layer 1/2 pushblocks

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:23

Sorry @EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) , I don't wanna flood this forum with threads, but there is one last idea, I had a few days ago, when I was making some experiments with your "FreezeWater" LWeapon Script.

I advanced it a little, so it will only change water combos into next, if a certain flag is placed under them, and it can also turn Damage 1/2 herat combos into next, also checking flags.

In fact I think, frezzing water is a good way to move Pushblocks about water barriers.
But the water should be Walk/Swimable (without unchecking "can't Swim in unwalkable Water") 
...and having a (maybe inherent) Flag under all Water "-Edges" and "-Corners" is a waste of Flags IMO.

What if there was a quest rule
"Pushblocks can't be pushed on Liquid" and maybe, even a second "PushBlucks will sink in Liquid"
...Like Blockholes (Block->Next) but using a constant combo or clipping.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2021 00:24

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:29

Just BTW, I added a combo data script, to turn the screen's undercombo into melting (cycking) ice->water combos, if they appear on assigned "CF_FREEZEWATER" flags.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 00:33

oh, this is a side effect of non-solid water, right
oh while we're at it
smart pushblocks check all 4 quadrants of the combo for solidity, right

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:34

I think so, ye

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2021 00:34

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/920108592349216828/920111571668205608/unknown.png)
If that's set, they can't be pushed into solids

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:35

But the Water shall not be solid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2021 00:35

yeah, that seems interesting
didn't think about that

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:35

And "Can't swim in solid Water" needs to stay checked

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:37

So Link shall be be enabled to swim in walkable water,but not in solid
...but pushblocks shall not be pushed onto any liquid (solid, walkable or lava)
...or else, you can decide to push em on, but they sink in it 🙂

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:45

Maybe it can be an attribute of the water combo, instead of a questrule?

...so, the pushblocks will not have to check the water, the water will check the pushblocks...?

The Water combos could possibly have an attribute "No PushBlocks"
or "Push Blocks will sink".

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:52

...cause, if only the side- and edge water combos will check the pushblock position and push state, they will only have the chekc (max) two (min) one edge(s)

...instead of one more check one all four corner of the pushblocks

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/14/2021 01:26

I'll look into that
(replying to @ Bagu "Maybe it can be an attribute…"): "push blocks will sink" already exists; it's the "block hole" flag

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 05:29

Yeah, but I thought of instant Liquid Block Hole (like mentioned in my earlier post)

https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/920108592349216828/920108607440318474

And Having an extra BlockHole->Next Flag under each Water Combo, is same kind of flag waste as having a NoPushblocks flag under each Water Combo.

An engine Block->Liquid replacement would be much better, so there would be no need for each pushblock to have a "->Next" Combo following.

...and a Block that sinks in a Left-Edge WaterCombo would need another "->Next" combo, than one that sinks in Right-Edge Water Combos.
...Anyting else causes odd graphics.
...but exactly this is the Problem, cause "There can be only ONE" ->Next combo 🙂

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 05:51

I think, Pushblocks (if "sinkable") should turn into that watercombo, that they were pushed onto (and create a "Drown" Animation ...as sprites who can drown when they collide with liquids.)

=== @ vlamart 12/14/2021 19:27

It would be interesting to have the opposite idea for pits. Like pushing a block over a pit to use its undercombo to make a bridge over the pit

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 20:21

That's definitly intressting, @ vlamart 

Thanks for mentioning, cause I tried and just noticed that Pits offer exactly that Pushblock interaction, that I would wish for liquid.

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 20:25

The Puhblock disappears, the combo creates a "Fall" sprite (drown in case of liquids) and evrything else stays as it is (without any ->Next combos)

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 04:32

ZC lacks some animation frames that Z3 did, even if you set "Z3 Player Animation". It's divided into existing animation slots that need to have expanded frames, and things that require whole new animation slots.

Expansion of existing slots:

Floating - 2 frames per direction
Swimming: 4 frames per direction
Slash: 6 frames up/down, 7 frames left/right (set to 6 for all four???)
Pound: 3 exclusive frames to each direction. Not shared with stab/slash like they currently are

New slots:
Boomerang: 2 frames per direction
Hookshot: 1 frame per direction
Bug net: 7 frames per direction
Bow: 3 frames per direction (might be worth waiting until we have visible sprite bows?)

And a final note that the rods and canes both reuse the pound animation.
oops pressed enter too soon

`copy the animation code from`
hahahahhahahas
hahahahahahhahahahahahahhhhhhahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
that sentence is meaningless
do you mean link's animation or the net animation?
If the net animation, it's literally entirely different
if link's animation, it *is already fucking using the same code*
it sets the attacking action and attackclk

link

it sets `attackclk = duration` and `action = attacking`
that's literally all the net does
and appears to be all any other weapon does
animation stuff is all based on `action`
as for the action animation tiles, none of that is in any code relating to the net
that code is literally not different
that's just link's animation code
shared by *everything*
it's not like the net has some copy of animation setup or anything

aye, so there's probably some absolutely jank fuckery going on
but the actual animation code is shared
there's only 2 copies of link's animation code in the entire source
one of them is ZQ-only, used in the dialog to animate the previews
the other is ZC-only, used for actually displaying in-game
Now, here's a question for you

Link can now no longer move while bug netting and the net changes direction correctly.
However, the animation still starts a frame or two before the net spawns, and it only uses one frame (Slash), as opposed to the Slash + Stab animation for the slashing sword (I included both items in Init Data)

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 16:41

Also observe how Link goes back to a standing pose before the net's animation is even halfway-done, unlike the sword.
So the gameplay is perfect, it's just the animation that needs tuning.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 20:23

So, I think I edited the timing of both the bug net and link's animation while doing it to feel nice
(30 felt way too long; reduced it to 24 and it feels a lot better)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 20:26

There's a bit of an issue though; the bug net when facing right is either the only time the bug net lines up with Link's animation (if left handed), or the only time it *doesn't* line up with Link's animation (if right handed)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 20:29

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) any chance you could have a "unflipped right-facing bugnet" item flag? (so it mirrors the left facing bug net)
I can probably handle the animations from there (though it's looking increasingly likely that I need to implement a slash (continued) link animation v.v)

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 04:52

A new movement style for the Bug Net.  Used as a flag.

-The net completes a full 9-frame animation through the 8 directions, starting at one point beside Link and ending at that same point. The animation is clockwise no matter which direction Link faces.

-Where each net starts per-Link facing direction:
Up: To his left
Right: To his north
Down: To his right
Left: To his south
This means that the net always starts on Link's left-hand side.
Sorry for the delay in testing out the bug net, but I didn't think to compare the animation to Z3 until now that I'm documenting all that frame data.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2021 07:59

This will probably wait a bit, because.... frankly handling that many frames sounds suuuper painful

So this is an idea where like Oracle of Ages, if you stand on a block destination (name?) and swap with a combo with this attribute, it sets the block destination to be "triggered" and renders the block unpushable if it has a pushable flag on it, just like any other pushblock that is pushed onto a block destination.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:14

oh, duh, I haven't posted that
(hoping A100 comes out soon, just need @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) to finish the last few QRs
pretty sure it wouldn't trigger though
since that's in the pushing code

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:14

But the fact that this was one of my friends' first thoughts when hearing about the switch hook seems to show it's important
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "since that's in the pushing c…"): Yeah I figured

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:15

also, pushblocks on layers still only trigger things on *their layer*
need to fix that

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:15

HOLD it
if you have two blocks and two destinations on different layers
that could mean you could have like, color or symbol coded blocks and destinations
make it a QR at least please

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:16

A block being switch-hooked onto a block hole on the same layer would switch places with each other, not trigger
without doing a lot of work....
blehg
so much to do still

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:18

perhaps a combo type or "Unswappable Block Hole" combo flag that gets checked and sets it to not swap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:50

@ P-Tux7 hope you're up for some testing
because now:
-Block holes should apply on layer 0 only (+1&2 if the qr for pushblocks on 1&2 is on), UNLESS the new QR is *enabled* to make them do same layer only.
-Switchhooks should not be able to swap with `Push->Wait` combo types if they would not be pushable (i.e. enemies on screen)
-Switchhooks swapping with any push combo should trigger block holes that it swaps pushblocks onto

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:56

sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:56

Anything that is 'breakable' with the switchhook will ignore this, as... the combo breaks, instead of filling the hole
so a pushable `Bush->Next` that you swap into a hole would not trigger the hole

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:56

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "-Switchhooks should not be ab…"): you know
how does this interact with heavy/very heavy pushblock flags

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:57

It doesn't
If you use the `SwitchHook Block` combo type, you can require a certain level of switchhook to switch with it

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:57

whoa

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:57

but other than that, if it's switchable it's switchable

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:57

np

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:59

For fucks sake
`cmb2` is apparently a constant in some header somewhere
that's what I get for trying to name my combo variables simply....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:01

@ P-Tux7 here's a full buildpack

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/920411185940152381/920797901117071440/buildpack.zip
Also, push combos that have been 'locked in place' won't be switchable
...which, while it includes block holes, sadly ALSO includes `Push Once` blocks that have been pushed

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 22:02

yeah that's what i'd hope
oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:03

To change that... would mean rewriting how push once's are handled

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 22:03

i dunno if you could swap them off in oracles, but it's not like zc has lttp/gb style "un-pushable" buttons

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:03

yeah
I've scripted such before easily
it was a lens puzzle, so I just used ffcs that were visible to lens only, and checking when a block was below every one of them
but, the whole `click into place` idea means they aren't going to move again
....the question is, should a push once click into place when you swap with it, even if you haven't pushed it?
that would make it `one push OR one swap`, consistently

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:07

oh, wait... hmmm
so, interesting tidbit
if you have a blockhole on a different layer, as it is now, the hole could eat multiple blocks.... because the hole itself isn't being overwritten
that's not right
uhg, and I forgot block *triggers*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:20

OOOKAY
So block holes are fairly easy
Block TRIGGERS are fucking hard

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:22

So, the way I have it set up now
If you layer multiple `Block Hole`s on top of each other
each can eat a block
first the one on the same layer as the block, then counting up 0,1,2
Block Triggers should ALL trigger
and, triggers on layers other than the one the block is on will become that layer's undercombo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:26

....I think that's handled for BLOCKS, now to handle it for SWITCHHOOKS
....frankly I should just make the switchhook run the block placement code....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:43

HOOOOOOOOOOKAY
If you thought pushblocks were jank
now, switchhooking a pushblock
will spawn a movingblock sprite object
and immediately trigger it 'clicking into place', which should *automatically* resolve all triggers the same as though it were pushed
building now

and it seems like swapping a block onto the block trigger doesn't trigger it (i only set up the block trigger in this last one oops), but pushing it does (as normal)
@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:13

hmmm
OK, so the hooking but not swapping effect is normal
the switchhook block combo type does the same if it's set to `only swap with combo 0` but you try to swap it with a non-0 combo
that's showing `yes this is switchable, but something's in the way`
apparently it's setting the pushed flag even if it's a many type....

Something is; the block is already clicked into place

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:15

except for the keese existing, but that SHOULD make it just not hook, right?

oh yeah it's a wait combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:16

the wait combo is checked when it tries to actually swap you with the block, not when it initially grabs it

they... don't?
they drop at Link's position

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:32

All sprite objects that are under the switch effect are paused; this includes the switchhook weapon itself, as it also flickers/rises with those effects. Such objects will neither move nor animate, and only will run their scripts if `Switchhooked Objects Run Scripts` is set.

I'd really appreciate a simpler relational combo system that only supports 16x16 pieces and only has these combos. Most dungeons don't need all of the options that current relational combos have, and it's a pain to set up for tile makers and quest makers alike.

A flag for the switch hook that makes it only use its cost if the swap is successful. This means the cost is not subtracted if the hook hits something non-hookable or something that IS hookable, but doesn't have an actual swap happen (such as a wait pushblock while an enemy is on-screen).

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:21

So as it is charge scrolls use their cost when you successfully charge up, not when you actually release the button to use the charged attack. This means that you can waste your magic on a spin attack or hammer quake without actually doing anything because you got hit after you charged but before you let go of the button.

With this item flag or QR the cost would only be subtracted when you let go of the button and the sword/hammer is swung.

Link instantly re-enters the cave or stairs upon exiting.  The warping tiles shouldn't be active until link steps off of it.

=== @ tim 12/17/2021 23:03

is this overworld or dungeons?
or both

@tim That's exactly where I discovered it.  I go into the cave to get the sword and as I leave the cave, link instantly re enters the cave leaving me trapped.  This is definitely game breaking bug.

The Mirror item class should have a secondary Warp effect and sound effect, to be used when the DMap flag "Mirror Continues instead of Warping" is set, as it worked in A Link to the Past.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 12/18/2021 01:22

More additions specific to the Mirror.
A - A screen with a "No Mirror Into" flag.
B - A "cannot mirror onto" combo Flag
C - A Item Option / QR where if you bonk on these "No Mirror", you get a wavy screen effect, similar to how Oracle of Ages prevented time travel in some places.

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "C - A Item Option / QR where…"): This one is a bit tougher... you already have the warp effect playing

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 12/19/2021 00:29

I think it just depends on how Mirror bonking works. If it loads the screen, shows it for a moment, then warps you back, idea idea is that a consistent wavy effect plays, implying something is preventing you from warping there.
(based on how it looks in Ages)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/19/2021 00:48

It plays a warp of whichever effect to go there
and then immediately starts a warp back as soon as the warp there finishes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/19/2021 03:05

Showcases the `No Mirror` flag (the orange tiles on the left have it).
Also showcases the return portal bonking you back, due to temp secrets.
The `Disable Mirror` screen flag also exists, making it treat the entire screen area as `No Mirror` flag.

Shot Types:
-3-way spread
-5-way spread
-4-directional

Flags/Attributes
-Only Appears On Initial Spawn Point (LTTP/LA wizzrobes. Applies to Teleporting only. Will always pick its spawn point for every time it appears)
-Can Be Knocked Back (idk if this works by setting the knockbackability via scripts)
-Kind Phasing (Phasing only. When phasing, refuses to phase in any of the 3 8-way directions closest to Link and will keep rerolling until it gets one of the five others. This prevents a Wizzrobe to the face)
-Summoners Kill Children When Dead - Enemies are "owned" by the Wizzrobe that summoned them. When the Wizzrobe dies, they die too. Perhaps should also apply to walking enemies, but if it can't it's no biggie. Most summoning enemies I've seen people make are Wizzrobes
-Summon Fixed Amount of Enemies: Instead of summoning 1-3 enemies at random, always summon an amount of enemies equal to the value in the next attribute.
-How Many Enemies To Summon: See above. Useless unless the above flag is checked

## ✅🔒enlarged enemy death animations broken (#1103)

=== @ Zaidyer 12/18/2021 23:31

2.55 offers fine control over enemies’ size and hitboxes, but if you make their sprites any bigger than 1 tile it also applies to whatever death sprite you’ve set. But not the way you’d think. Because it still animates by “moving forward along the tile page” 16 pixels per frame. so a traditional 1-tile sized death animation will be surrounded by garbage tiles, while animations drawn at the intended size look broken.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/18/2021 23:37

This would probably be something good to solve by default, but does setting the enemy to have a custom death sprite and setting that sprite to be 2x2 tiles in the "Weapons/Misc" graphic editor work?
Make sure the QR(s?) for Per-Enemy Weapon/Spawn/Death/Shadow Sprites are on so you can assign them per-enemy in the Enemy Editor.

=== @ Zaidyer 12/18/2021 23:38

The sprite can’t be set larger than 1 tile in the sprite editor. It inherits the size attributes of the enemy that calls for it.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/18/2021 23:38

(That's a thing now too if you haven't noticed. Now all walking enemies can have LTTP-style shadows, even custom ones tailored to their size)
(replying to @ Zaidyer "The sprite can’t be set large…"): Okay that's... odd
I must have misremembered, sorry.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/18/2021 23:39

yeah, all a sprite data does is give a tile and animation data
no size data
and the code used clearly doesn't account for size changes

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 00:10

i presume it isn't but should be doing the anim.skip x and y like combos can and large enemies do

=== @ Zaidyer 12/19/2021 21:01

The animation is 6 frames long, and therefore it should look like it's showing four of the same number in a single frame of animation, and go all the way up to showing four 6s.
Instead, it looks like this, and stops after showing four 3s, indicating that even though the bounding box of the animation is 2 tiles wide, it's only advancing across the tile page 1 tile per frame.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 21:09

this should probably be checked for spawns and shadows too

=== @ Zaidyer 12/20/2021 02:30

Further testing reveals that the reason the fix didn't appear to work was because the Compatibility Rule "hard-coded shadow/spawn/death anim frames" was enabled.

=== @ Zaidyer 12/20/2021 02:37

So technically, this bug *is* fixed, but not for the hard-coded variety of death animations. Not sure if there's a reason to fix those.

A flag for these items that kills them if they hit a solid combo.

-Sword (beams)
-Wand (magic)
-Candle (fire)
-Byrna (beams)
-Boomerang (Itself)
-Arrows (Themselves)
-Din's Fire (fire)

In short, the same that happens if they hit the edge of the screen or are hit by an enemy that blocks them. So sword beams "explode", arrows "tink", etc.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 01:46

Good for nerfing or differentiating the arrows or wand, or making higher-level items that can go through solid combos as their "upgrade". Also good for LTTP/GBC style gameplay

Thread from PureZC:
https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=76556
Details:
Zelda.exe does not display the correct animations for "Slash", "Stab" and "Pound" when the Animation Style is set to "Zelda 3". Instead, Zelda.exe defaults to the standard behavior of "Original" and "BS-Zelda" animation styles.
While editing and previewing Link's sprites in ZQuest, these animations are displayed correctly. "Slash" is expanded to 6 unique frames of animation, "Stab" is expanded to 3 unique frames of animation, and "Pound" is expanded to 3 unique frames of animation. This represents the original intention of the developer who first implemented Zelda 3 animation for Link, but it was never fully implemented in Zelda.exe itself.

=== @ Zaidyer 12/19/2021 16:26

Additionally, "Charge" does not reset to the first frame when the player stops moving. Instead, it defaults to the way it works in "Original" and "BS Zelda" styles, where it will stop on the current frame and stay that way until the player does something.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 17:36

The problem here is mostly the fact that the sword is only one tile long
which doesn't work well with that graphical style
it being behind the head there is the exact proper *hitbox* alignment for it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 10:38

I mean, we could have the sword extend outwards more with positioning, though there might be some disjointed hitboxes involved

It'd be more awkward for collision to make it look better graphically

Worth noting that when the sword is fully-extended (frame 6 here) the animation speed *changes* for that particular frame
Normally the animation speed is 1 (or 17 milliseconds), for frame 6 here it's 4 (or 67 milliseconds)

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/922161694782943322/932953415942807573/link_attack_zoom-x1_speed-100l.gif)

And for good measure, left facing. This is mirrored for right facing, obvs

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 11:11

Okay so it looks like the sword is 16x16 from a glance
but the hitbox would extend further down when up facing, so as to catch enemies inside of link

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 11:13

also that adds up to 12 frames of sword slashing; but the ZQ preview seems to be *24* frames of slashing

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 11:21

Possibly due to conjecture
It was really hard to measure this stuff 15 years ago

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 11:25

The sword is indeed 16x16 except for when it’s 16x8 or 8x16. Not counting the Master Sword which *looks* bigger but may in fact not have a bigger hitbox

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 11:26

In A Link to the Past, the sprites for the Master Sword are drawn for the same tile size as the Fighter Sword, and while slashing the game adds an extra specially drawn 8x8 tile to the tip to make it longer.
Except when it doesn’t do that
It won’t lengthen the Master Sword if you slash while walking down a slow walk combo on the overworld
It doesn’t lengthen it *ever* in the GBA port

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 11:33

Ergo I think “longer sword” features would probably work differently in ZC if they’re attempted at all

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 12:45

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 19:19

Okay, so the sword needs to be repositioned with big Link in all directions
except maybe down? Idk
But left, right, and up aren't cutting it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 19:32

Either way, the Link sprites themselves are working
though it looks terrible without working on the weapons as well; the best looking one is the sword slash, which looks kinda decent
But stabbing and hammer both draw *under* Link and can barely be seen

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:01

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Okay, so the sword needs to b…"): this should preferably be a customizable stored offset given that there's at least two big link sprites (LTTP, Minish Cap)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:04

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ""): wait, is this a shadow being drawn under Link, or is it part of the sprite

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:08

if it's part of the sprite it looks very weird when used with roc's feather and falling down from a warp pit, and lttp uses it for a lot of other shenanigans as well (while he's invisible when hurt, while he's invisible when using the magic cape, gb cliffs, pegasus boots bonking)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:10

(other uses for constant drawn shadows include having an item on the floor or while falling from the ceiling have a shadow on the ground but not while held up, and telling the Z-Axis [if enabled] of jumping/flying enemies + all enemies that fall from ceilings not looking weird)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:11

you know, i don't know if we could fit it (maybe as an item flag or quest rule?), but invisible enemies that only display their shadows until you get the amulet would be hilarious

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 22:11

Shadows are one thing, but the bigger issue here are the hard-coded weapon offsets

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:12

(replying to @ Zaidyer "The sword is indeed 16x16 exc…"): IIRC, it does.

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 22:12

Might have to make those adjustable to account for variance in sprites

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:13

The other issue is that even if you COULD adjust the offsets from the item editor tab... what about the *beam*?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 14:08

the new animations are kinda in in the nightly; they look bad without me doing the weapon portion, but the sprite portion should work

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 19:43

oh?
also hold on a sec

(Magenta/purple: Tile delineators
Cyan: Tile that I should pick in the player sprite picker? Maybe?
Blue: Link's hitbox if set to Big Player Hitbox)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 20:11

The top one
But
cyan should be where the blue is

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 20:15

ohh ok
i thought it was upper left since it was like that for enemies
wait so do big link sprites use all 6 tiles, or just the 32x32 pixel portion in the center of that image?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 20:20

just the 32x32 portion

But it's like, a lot of frames of walking
4 frames of slashing (6 when 180 sword gets added)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:45

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:50

so is the "wands and canes use pound" rule thing still unimplemented?
(i imagine for sake of implementation the rule being on would ignore both whether the wand/cane can melee damage and whether it uses slash or not)

link's framedata when using the hammer in lttp:
1st tile: 3 frames
2nd tile: 4 frames
3rd tile: 17 frames
appears to be same numbers for all directions

oh, you know what? even though it's inaccurate to LTTP, that means the hammer sparks should start on frame 8 as well since that's when the hammer touches the ground
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
the wand/hammer frames are synced up to each link frame, no desync or anything. they also make link unable to move until the animation is complete. so he's paused for 13 frames using a rod, and 24 frames using the hammer
(meta, MessageType.pins_add)

Changelog for Alpha 102 reports Z3 Animation fixes but I'm not seeing any
ZQuest still plays the long (correct) animations while ZC falls back to BS-Zelda style

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2022 13:42

Does that include the weird 2-frame swimming/swim moving?
Also, make sure to save your quest in Alpha 102 - I'm sure there's compatibility checks in place so older quests use the old buggy kind

=== @ Zaidyer 01/25/2022 13:48

Okay so I didn't notice there was a new compatibility rule I needed to uncheck
So far it's hard to tell that the new animations are working with the base A Link to the Past sprites, but I did some frame-by-frame checks and they do work now. Albeit strangely for some weapons.

=== @ Zaidyer 01/25/2022 13:50

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) Hookshot is doing a weird thing where you see frame 1 of Stab while the weapon is being drawn, then at the very end when it's retracted all the way and stops being drawn you see frame 2 of Stab

=== @ Zaidyer 01/25/2022 13:53

The full Slash animation for the Sword is played but cuts out before the end, I presume this is based on earlier discussion here about doing that for 90-degree slashing

=== @ Zaidyer 01/25/2022 13:54

The full 3-frame Hammer animation isn't working though. It switches from Hammer to Stab at the end.

=== @ Zaidyer 01/25/2022 14:06

That's not a case of mistaken sprites on my end either, I used different ones for each animation and it definitely changes from Hammer to Stab

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2022 14:08

I'll also look into the death animation tomorrow

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2022 14:09

Besides Link flopping in Z3, Z3 Link uses two walking frames of animation while rotating in ZC, instead of Z3 where he only used the standing frames

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2022 14:38

Also perhaps a Boomerang toss/catch sprite, and a QR that makes the boomerang have a delay to it before spawning, as well as showing in Link's hand during the delay. I'll have to crunch the frames there too

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/25/2022 22:52

(replying to @ Zaidyer "@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) Hooksh…"): ah shoot, I need to have an exception for the hookshot

=== @ P-Tux7 01/26/2022 00:18

Oh turns out there's no catch sprite even if you stand still
Boomerang hold: 7 frames
Boomerang toss (same as stab/hookshot): 6 frames

=== @ P-Tux7 01/26/2022 00:47

Hurt frames
Code:
H: Hurt, visible
I: Invisible except for shadow (which becomes small during this animation)
HHIHIHIHIHIHIHIHIHI
In short, 1 extra hurt frame at the beginning, then 18 more frames where hurt and invisible are alternated
Total: 19

=== @ P-Tux7 01/26/2022 00:56

Death frames:
72 hurt frames in the direction that Link is facing (NO flickering)
6 down-stand frames
6 left-stand frames
6 up-stand frames
6 right-stand frames
6 down-stand frames
6 left-stand frames
6 up-stand frames
6 right-stand frames
6 down-stand frames
6 left-stand frames
6 up-stand frames
6 right-stand frames
4 Death frame 1
("Bonk" displays beneath Link for the first 4 frames of this next animation)
292(?) Death frame 2
Total: 440 (if this is longer than the Z1/ZC death animation, feel free to cut off the Death Frame 2)

Death frame 1 and 2 are always facing to the right, so we only need 1 death player sprite.
I'll try and get the boomerang/death bonk offsets later

=== @ P-Tux7 01/26/2022 00:58

(If you're wondering what the death bonk is, it's this. It's gotta be displayed separately due to being drawn beneath the player tiles)

When a block puzzle involves moving blocks on top of multiple Block Trigger (66) Flags, normally you need to push blocks on all of them. In 100, secrets are triggered as soon as you cover *one*.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/922214705328689154/922214750585258074/zc_screen00005.png)

The door at the bottom (Secret Flag 16) was opened after moving just one block onto a Block Trigger

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 20:50

Sorry. This was probably a result of me asking for switchhooked pushblocks (if you set them to have the switch hookable attribute) to depress block triggers if you swap them onto one

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 20:57

Like the diamonds in Oracle of Ages
There's also a setting on the dedicated Switch Hook Blocks to let them depress block triggers even if the block itself is unpushable, much like those diaminds.

err, no there isn't

Bah dammit
It's checking one fewer layer than it should for triggers because I have a `<` not `<=`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2021 04:39

so what exactly is happening wrong?

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:42

The bug I reported
Layer -2 is rendering over Layer 0, Layer 2 is background on all screens in the first screenshot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2021 04:44

dmap flag layer 2 is background, screen flag layer 2 is background, or both?

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:44

Both

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2021 04:44

They are a toggle
both being enabled disables it

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:45

...
I think it would be clearer if it was listed as a toggle on the screen data end
It didn't used to be a toggle

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2021 04:47

It was *supposed* to be a toggle
but zoria doesn't know how to do shit right

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:48

Oh
Its still listed as Layer -2 in screen data

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:49

There now it's working
ZC still has oddities with viewing Layer 2 as background even with the appropriate setting is checked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:57

What oddities?

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 03:02

Namely the preview for other screens does not use the Layer 2 as background property when the view option "View Layer 2 as background" is checked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 03:03

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?
(For the record, the view as bg option also is toggled by the screen flag)
(...or, should be, at least)

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 03:05

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "(For the record, the view as…"): The screen flag toggles it fine and it works with adjacent screens that also have the flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 03:09

So adjacent screens just ignore the view option?
Pretty sure @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) could probably fix that easily enough

Ex: I have a 4 frame combo, if i go into the combo editor when the animation is on frame 1, it is fine. But if I enter the combo editor when the combo animation is on, say, the second frame, then the preview will show that frame +3 (it doesnt know the starting frame is already on frame 2 so it goes off of the intended cycle)

=== @ cbailey78 12/20/2021 23:09

I don't know if this is done, but I think i think we should have the ability to collect more than 8 triforce pieces to have a longer quest especially if the quest was a really good enjoyable one.  There have been times I would enjoy the quest but the end is nearing.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 23:41

Agreed
I could have sworn I also made a request to have the Triforce Gate room allow you to set a number of triforce pieces that you need. Which would go well with this, and also allows for some places you can go when you've got only part of the triforce but not all of it.

=== @ cbailey78 12/21/2021 00:06

When I made a triforce piece above number 8, the tile becomes invisible until I set it below number 8, then it's visible.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 07:32

To make this work for triforce rooms, would be easy enough
to make this work for the triforce on the subscreen, would be nearly impossible
...To allow displaying the current triforce count you own on the subscreen, might be doable, but will be painful

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 07:42

proposal: a triforce subscreen object that changes to the next tile when the triforce # in its properties has been obtained
or wait, can't one just display the triforce piece ITEM in the subscreen?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 07:52

^That I believe would display if you have it in the current dungeon
similarly to map/compass
new subscreen objects are not something I'll be touching
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) is free if she's insane enough

=== @ P-Tux7 12/24/2021 22:08

i wonder if there could be an individual triforce piece subscreen object where it displays a set tile (from an attribute) once you have a triforce from the level equal to the object's Level attribute
so for level 1's triforce you'd set an object with the Level property of 1 and its tile set to the left triforce
Level 2, level property is 2 and you pick the right facing triforce tile

There should be an options to set up combos that can damage the player as Torches that light up a room also.  This would be mainly fires on the ground as seen by old men in caves if you use fire by itself alone as a tile in dungeons or map screens etc.

=== @ cbailey78 12/21/2021 05:42

I think we should have a touch - next combos where combo tile changes to the next when link touches it whereas step - next combo type which we have when the tile changes when link is completely on it.  This would be essential for crumbling bridge tiles in Zelda 2.

=== @ Alucard648 12/21/2021 05:45

I think, this feature could be implemented as special case of handling step->* combo types for combos that have full or partial solidity.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 07:30

so, would he touch something solid if he steps next to it, or only if he pushes into it? (Gravity would 'push' down in sideview, of course)
the difference more being, if you had a 1-tall gap, would he touch the floor and the ceiling at once, or only touch the ceiling if he jumps into it?
or, in non-sideview, if you walk along a mountain, are you touching every bit of it, or do you need to push towards the mountain to trigger it?

=== @ Alucard648 12/23/2021 08:14

Top-down: must push against to trigger.
Sideview: sides -> push to trigger. Top -> just step on it, like crumbling bridges in Z2. Bottom -> bonk against to tringger, like Mario.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 08:19

so, any combo that is inside Link's 16x16 will trigger
and any combo that has its' solidity prevent Link from moving (either from gravity, manual movement, or jumping), will trigger
....not gonna be the easiest to add, but shouldn't be THAT bad.

So I accidentally fixed it with a bandaid fix, but the real problem was that the ANONE compat rule was being flagged for pre-2.55 quests when it shouldn't have been. Fixed.

=== @ Moosh 12/22/2021 02:54

A bunch of the fonts Zoria added for 2.55 have some characters that look botched, presumably from being scaled down from their base resolution. For example, the lowercase s in Sherwood looks like a g. Could we touch these up to look more presentable?
I'd be willing to edit them myself if need be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2021 04:03

If you want to submit a revised `fonts.dat` that you feel is better, feel free
just don't change any fonts that existed in 2.53

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/22/2021 06:56

Aren't the fonts that Zoria added technically his copyright?
Wouldn't he have a leg to stand on if we kept them?

=== @ Moosh 12/22/2021 07:24

That's a good question. I assumed that given how Zoria was about things the fonts he added would be public domain. I doubt he made any of them himself

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/22/2021 07:32

I remember him making a fuss about this

=== @ Moosh 12/22/2021 07:33

Looking at the list the ones that appear to have downscaling crust are:
-Sherwood
-Fantasy Letters
-COCO Mode I

=== @ Moosh 12/22/2021 13:06

Hmm, tried editing fonts.dat and it's giving me errors and crashing. Presumably because my images are in the wrong format. Any idea what exactly it's expecting? Tried bmp and pcx, seems Gimp may be up to no good again

Here's the example I was testing with. Also the one I'm least certain about "fixing" because it's so scuffed I can't tell what it was supposed to be and have no idea where Zoria got the original aside from that it resembles this one:

I'd use only the allegro tools

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2021 02:10

Also crashes when saved with aseprite :/

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:10

Then I have no idea
I've never edited fonts.dat, only qst.dat

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2021 02:26

Hmm okay managed to get it to not crash but then I get the ever so helpful "error saving [path]"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:26

Did it save the .dat file?
I've gotten a saving error for the ".h" file it's also supposed to save
But that can be ignored, as long as the .dat is updated

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2021 02:27

It does appear it saved my chances
We have no idea what these supposed errors are?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:28

It's failing to save the header file
I have no idea why
But it also isn't that important
Because it can function without it
All the header does is define a bunch of constants for accessing the dat file
Which is extra hilarious getting the error for qst.dat
Because that has one file in it, so literally just one constant of value 0 in its header...

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2021 02:30

welp

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2021 09:55

Talked to Zoria a bit about the source of the fonts in question. Apparently he redrew them by hand off of references and that's why they have these flaws 🤔
Also gave me this to pass along. I'm pretty sure you guys removed the splash screen altogether but if it's still there, fixed typo

Yeah, we removed the splash screen entirely
it was dumb

=== @ Moosh 12/30/2021 09:59

Fonts affected should be Sherwood (minor edits), Coco Mode 1, Coupe, and Sinclair QL (this one appears to be very similar to Coupe for some reason)

=== @ Moosh 12/30/2021 10:01

The last two required resizing some of the characters, but those characters were also completely broken so...
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) I wouldn't know anything about this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/17/2022 20:42

uhh
if you want to check it, just replace the `classic_fonts.dat` and see if the fonts look right
and if they do, then.... it can replace the `classic_fonts.dat` in the repo

=== @ Moosh 12/22/2021 11:23

Quick access to the string editor can be handy when performing some story and script related stuff. When room data got merged into one menu the S hotkey was freed up again. Could the hotkey for opening the string table be shortened from Alt Q, S to just S? (This'd also ease up some muscle memory for me since I frequently used to use the A and S hotkeys to preview screen special items and the string table)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 07:23

That did used to be the room string, huh?

Dying while the system is paused through F3 and using F4 to frame advance hangs ZC.
You cannot use F3 to unpause the program or F4 to continue to frame advance. F6 is shut down during this time as usual. This results in the program being hung and needing to F9 or F10 to reset or quit.

ffs

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 02:39

Also the Current Life counter does not draw during the death animation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:41

Is that an engine subscreen object?

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 02:56

Yes
Counter, Curret Life

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:58

Check if that object draws during death animation in 2.50.2/2.53 if you can?
I don't feel like that would have changed

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 02:59

That object was not present in 2.53

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:59

Oh?
It's new??
Who the fuck added new engine subscreen stuff

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 02:59

Okay resolved the life counter disappearing on 0 thing
Had to tick "Show Zero"
Which is pretty confusing tbh given the other things that display 0s

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 04:01

Yeah, if it doesn't show 0, then it just shows nothing when the counter is empty

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:56

(replying to @ Orithan "Dying while the system is pau…"): need a quest that this occurs in

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 06:57

Unable to reproduce this in a fresh file?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:57

correct

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 06:58

Because I don't know what in the world does this in the two quest files I've had it in.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:58

Do you have a `hero onDeath` script assigned?

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 06:59

Only in the case of Ryuu. Soul Hunter, the quest I posted the screenshot from, doesn't
Unless... that script is empty
I typically assign all the globals with empty files when I start a project and fill them where needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:59

and, `ZScript->Quest Script Settings->Hero OnDeath Script runs AFTER engine death animation`?

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 06:59

No. Not this rule

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 07:03

aha
only happens with that rule off and an ondeath script assigned
and that rule defaults to on in fresh quests

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 07:04

I run with that rule off because I want to play my own death animation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 07:06

*OH*
So, it sets `Playing = false` to disable F6
but that also disables F3/F4
and normally that's fine
because the engine death animation forcibly undoes F3 mode
but the onDeath script does NOT do that
it needs to

okay so first open this quest

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923418491292385300/923418540655149086/typeb.qst
it's a 1.90 tileset saved in 2.55
and go to sprite data and open one of the sprites, then go to pick a tile for it
at that screen, press escape to back out of it, then again to back out of the sprite, then again to back out of the sprite list
all the combos are blanked out

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 03:38

wait what the absolute fuck
no
just OPENING and picking a tile for a sprite in that dialog causes all the combos to be blanked out

ok so good news and bad news

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:43

and probably version check related on quest load

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:43

this does not happen with 1.92 tilesets

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:44

I think I remember deedee mentioning something about 1.90 quest loading being weird
it probably has a separate block that wasn't handled

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:44

the bad news is that this happens even with an unmodified revenge 2 tileset
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=tilesets&id=7

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:44

it probably would happen to ANY 1.90 quest

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:44

yeah the good news here is that saving a 1.90 quest in 2.55 isn't what's fucking it up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:44

for the record, the sprite data has very little to do with it

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:44

so it's not permanently borked unless you save the quest AFTER that happens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:44

it's just when it tries to reset all combo animations
it reads every combo as having an original tile of 0
so it

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:45

oh haha those didn't EXIST in 1.90

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:45

resets them all to 0
it should be copying the tile to the originaltile
on quest load
but clearly it's doing something weird for 1.90 right now

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:45

hold on lemme grab a 1.84 quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:46

So, in this example
you're blitting to the bitmap on layer 1
and then  blitting from the bitmap on layer 0
doesn't show that draw
because it hasn't happened yet
...I see no bug with what this test quest showcases @ Orithan, this seems completely correct
If I change it to blit the bitmap on layer 1
it displays, regardless of whether the circle draw is layer 0 or 1

Similar to conveyor belts, this is a flag (to enable it) and attribute for the Slow Walk combo that multiplies Link's speed by the number instead of being hardcoded. @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

The Recorder Whistle sound effect repeats playing after one use of the item. They do not stop playing unless you left a screen.
This happens in Alpha 2.55 the latest one.

I just wondered why `this->Scale = ...` is not working in FFC Scripts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/25/2021 17:21

ffcs are not sprite objects
they do not use sprite drawing mechanics such as scale

=== @ Bagu 12/25/2021 17:28

...oh
I just thought it might be cool for animated cutscenes
Makin things moving closer to "camera"

=== @ Bagu 12/25/2021 17:30

But I guess I could also create scripted (0 Hitbox) LWeapons, using custom sprites for those kind of sequences

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/25/2021 17:31

Also a great thing to keep in mind
is lweapons of type `LW_SPARKLE` will automatically die when their animation ends once
so if you want to create animations that will run through once, you can spawn that on those and not need to worry about killing it before it loops

=== @ Bagu 12/25/2021 17:33

...genius  clue!!!

## Separate Hookshot Hook or chain sprites when coming back. (#1132)

Status: open

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 12/25/2021 19:15

I have no idea if this is even possible, and it's certainly extremely low on the scale of usefulness, but here's the thought:

Separate vertical/horizontal sprites for the Hookshot hook and the Hookshot chain when retracting and after having been fired.

So you could have an open grabby-style metal hookshot hook hurtling towards a wooden target, its rope loose and wavy trailing behind it, but then the hook hits its target and visibly closes, and the rope goes taut and turns into a straight line as it pulls you towards it.

Also, a specific sound when contact is made.  But I suppose that's a separate suggestion.

Thoughts?  Is this feasible and reasonable, or unthinkable and unblinkable.

=== @ vlamart 12/28/2021 17:21

I like this idea, it would be also neat to add the switchhook teleportation animation/sprites to the hookshot (or at least just the poof)

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 12/29/2021 18:26

Yep, it's a fun thing to think about.

However, when you place down the bait in a Feed the Goriya room, it uses its inventory sprite instead of its placed item sprite.

Oh shit, this is an actual bug? Here I thought I was just losing it. ZC has been gaslighting the hell out of me

=== @ tacochopper 01/01/2022 13:19

i've noticed it for a few weeks now, thought i was going insane as well honestly
wasn't sure if it was something to do with my LTM setup or what
lol can report that it's happened again

=== @ tacochopper 01/01/2022 13:39

... hm
so i have zquest and classic running at the same time. before i booted up a fresh copy of the quest the hold sprite was still there. when i went back into zquest, and that sprite window, *after* i opened the quest, the hold sprite's reset itself

=== @ tacochopper 01/01/2022 13:43

YEP, can confirm it's happened again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2022 19:23

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @ tim 01/01/2022 19:40

resurfaced bug it seems

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:23

so on further testing, it only happens when both ZC and ZQ are running simultaneously. if the quest is being played without being open in the editor then the sprite works fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 03:24

. . . . . WHAT THE FUCK

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:25

i was thinking about that this morning, like what's the chances right
so i put it to the test

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 03:25

That should not be possible
having both programs running should have no effect on anything quest data related
at all
not a tiny bit

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:27

i'm gonna try and replicate it a few more times with zquest closed, but this makes no fucking sense honestly
just for reference

=== @ tim 01/02/2022 03:27

does it happen when
autosave happens
<:hmm:671849797119901710>

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:28

... possibly
although in that second screenshot
i had zquest open for a minute just to get the bug to appear

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:30

interestingly though it's not resetting the hold item sprite like it was last night
wut lol

nup spoke too soon, it reset it
running moscow modder's gb shield script so i think that may have been the cause for the trap sprite - LTM tiles

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) *what the fuck*

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 03:33

I don't know?

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:33

this is wild
closed zq and did it five times without the bug happening
i've turned off auto-saves in ZQ for the time being so i'll see if it happens with them deactivated in a bit

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:35

.... hm
it's not happening after i did a save as in ZQ, put the quest under a different name
and now i can't replicate it in the "new" retitled quest?
both open on ZC and ZQ

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:38

ah fuck knows, it's the like like bug all over again
i do wonder if it is related to the autosaves though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 04:32

could you send the non-retitled quest?

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 04:46

just messaged you!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 05:08

ty

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 16:33

lol it happened again. first time since earlier. auto-saves aren't turned on but i've been doing a lot of script compiling?

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 16:37

and barely minutes after resetting it and having zq and zc idle, it's happened again?? i don't get it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 16:44

So, you fix it in ZQ, you save in ZQ, you load ZC, and then it works fine in ZC?
but then, without touching ZQ again, after minutes it happens again?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 16:51

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "So, you fix it in ZQ, you sav…"): If it's breaking in the middle of ZC, that means ZC itself is breaking it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 17:12

^ But keep in mind it breaking in ZC *cannot* break it in ZQ, as ZC wouldn't write it back to the quest file
so if it ALSO breaks in ZQ
it breaks separately for both
likely in qst.cpp on quest load
but that wouldn't explain it working correctly for any length of time
it should be broken from the moment you load the quest

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 20:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "^ But keep in mind it breakin…"): Except, didn't you add something that saves sfx.dat to the quest file on quest load?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 20:23

shouldn't save anything from zc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 20:23

Oh, it's just a qst loader thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 20:23

it loads it from sfx.dat into the `customtunes[]` array
same way every single compat rule or compat change works

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 20:24

So yeah, this seems to be a qst.cpp bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 20:24

but that wouldn't explain it not happening for a few minutes
the question is
if you load the quest, it's broken
if you fix it, save, and reload the quest in zq, is it broken or fixed?

=== @ tacochopper 01/03/2022 00:32

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "So, you fix it in ZQ, you sav…"): I think this is about right? Although most of the times the bug’s been happening I’ve been seeing it in ZC first and then checking ZQ for the hold sprite data
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "if you fix it, save, and relo…"): I haven’t tried this yet, I’ll give it an attempt when I get up

=== @ tacochopper 01/03/2022 00:35

Every time I’ve been testing this for the last few days it’s been on a clean quest save. Not sure if that’s got anything to do with it but figure that might help regardless

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2022 00:35

that's always a good thing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/03/2022 12:58

I am very weirded out
I cannot reproduce this

=== @ tacochopper 01/03/2022 13:27

i reproduced it earlier again with the new quest lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/03/2022 13:27

wtf

=== @ tacochopper 01/03/2022 13:27

maybe we see if @ Moosh can make it happen
if it's happened to both of us then there's a solid chance it could be a similar cause, right?

=== @ tim 01/04/2022 00:12

uh
who first reported this

=== @ tim 01/04/2022 00:13

@ FireSeraphim
this is the same thing you had happen a few months back, ye?

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/04/2022 00:15

a similar thing yeah.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2022 06:22

It isn't the same thing
FS's issue was that the Flip value was being set to an absurdly high number somehow, and my fix for that was to cap the Flip value

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2022 06:24

@ tacochopper could you go to the About page (should be under ZC/ZQ/Etc) in ZQuest and screenshot it?
I need to know what build specifically you are using so I can build a debug build where I can reproduce it

=== @ tacochopper 01/04/2022 09:41

Sure, I’ll get that together after I’ve finished work

still on the way; unsure if P-Tux is done testing or not but there's a few issues I want to iron out

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2022 14:54

I didn't change anything but see if you can reproduce the issue in the latest code
This isn't confirmed stable, but see if this fixes the issue

time to destroy my computer 😄 i mean what

=== @ tacochopper 01/04/2022 15:19

after a handful of attempts trying to get it reproduced

wanna say around ten times?
basically just soft resetting until it occurred. initially i was going into the shop and purchasing an item and the hold up sprite was fine. this time it only happened after i put the item on the starting screen for ease of access
and sure enough, the sprite reset
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/926796022963908638/927944749422362695/zquest_gQ59IpuLew.png)

=== @ tacochopper 01/04/2022 15:23

hm, it's only happened once in twenty resets
feels like shiny hunting in pokemon

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:06

*sigh*
Alright, time to go digging again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:07

I'm baffled
If it ***ever*** shows correctly in ZC, it can't be qst.cpp, can it?

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:09

help me understand what else even has the power to change that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:09

From everything I can see here
I'd guess that a demon has posessed the program and decided to fuck with us
By far the most likely cause

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:12

now here's my question
is it actually setting the tile to zero
or it is being nulled into 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:12

... what's the difference?
NULL == 0

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:13

some code that is overwriting it vs some code that is removing the setting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:13

... what's the difference?

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:13

exactly what i just stated

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:13

Those both are `= 0;`
There is no difference between "removing" something and "overwriting it to 0"

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:14

there 100% is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:14

Then if you could elaborate

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:16

I think tim means if it's writing to something so high that it gets set to 0 for being too high
Which, I don't *think* it's handled that way? I think it'd just overflow and display a garbage value

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:16

There shouldn't be a "too high" for tiles anymore
It'd wrap, yeah

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:17

so i may have answered my own question
if something is unset, it usually shows a black tile, not even tile 0, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:18

Depends on the dialogue
Some dialogs draw tile 0 as tile 0

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:18

unless im still thinking in 2004

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:19

Others don't draw it if it's 0, thus showing the empty square
Both represent the same exact value

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:21

(replying to @ tim "unless im still thinking in 2…"): If something isn't *initialized*, it will grab random memory
so a random number each time probably
if something is set to NULL, it's just 0.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:22

Here we're getting 0, so something is probably nulling it somewhere
The oddity is that it doesn't break immediately in zc
But, that it doesn't JUST break in ZC, it also affects ZQ
Either there are two very similar but different bugs
Or the laws of physics are breaking down
Because while ZQ can affect ZC (error in the qst file,  for ex)
ZC ***cannot affect ZQ***
ZQ never loads any files that have been touched by ZC
There should be no possible way for that to happen

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:24

as the only thing ZC is actually writing is
cfg and sav

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:25

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Because while ZQ can affect Z…"): See, here's the thing, ZC loads the entire quest into memory when starting up
So it really shouldn't be ZQuest affecting ZC
you can delete the entire quest file IIRC or save over it IIRC and the changes won't take place until after you go back to the file select

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:26

No but, if the error is when saving the quest file...
Then ZQ affects ZC
Nothing to do with them both running at the same time
i.e. if ZQ were saving the tile wrong
But, that doesn't seem to be the case either

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:30

so there has to be some missing bracket somewhere
or something is setting this option while another command is being thrown
there has to be some command that is doing it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:31

Something has to be setting it to 0 in a file that both ZC and ZQuest call

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:31

and its only during some other option being set

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:32

And it has to be something that's consistently doing it in both simultaneously

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:36

*leers at allegro.log*

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:45

just left zq running for the past 20 mins
and box in question just has no image

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:46

?
What tile is it set to?

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:46

0 with a blank image

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:47

Oh?

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:47

resetting zq brings it back. let me see if it rots away again in the timeframe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:48

Definitely nothing qst.cpp then

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:52

🙂
look what the tile was just randomly set to

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/926796022963908638/928390523348213830/unknown.png)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:52

what the fucking hell

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:52

lmao

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/926796022963908638/928390631779340359/unknown.png)
this is just zq open

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:56

so what is the relevance of this tile besides it being the last tile allowed in pages

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:57

FLIP
of course it's fucking flip
And Tile
retghbsedhysf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:57

`setlinktile()` is one of the only things that modifies those values
and that is ONLY called when you hit OK after having clicked one of those squares in that dialog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:00

`setuplinktiles()` also modifies them, setting them to defaults; but that only occurs in qst.cpp on loading a quest, before it has read the sprites from the quest
the values can also be affected by `moving` tiles
because link sprites are set up (at least old ones, don't know if the new ones were...) to move if you move it's source tile
but that only writes the tile, not the flip

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:03

Okay, see, here's the other thing
SetSprite caps Flip at 3
Which means on being loaded, the sprites should be capped

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:04

yeah, that was our attempt at fixing this last time

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:04

it's worth noting that this is probably random memory overflowing from whatever is *before* the 1 handed hold sprite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:05

hmmm
`sideswimcastingspr`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:05

Given that the value being affected is [0][0][0] of an array

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:07

don't see anything immediately
and that's assuming that global variables in memory are guaranteed to be contiguous, which I'm not sure if is true?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:08

...wait a fucking moment
wait a fucking moment
`int32_t holdspr[2][3][3];`
that's `[2][3][3]`
not `[2][2][3]`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:09

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:09

someone expanded it

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:09

<:hmm:671849797119901710>

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:09

Zoria did

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:09

in the middle
WHY
WHY
It isn't being cleared or set properly

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:09

He wanted to add a Sword Holding Sprite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:09

it's clearing `2*2*3*sizeof(int32_t)`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:09

and there's stuff in qst.cpp that sets that
...ah.
I see

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:10

i reset and let it rot again

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/926796022963908638/928395037333667880/unknown.png)

WAIT, wtf
It just happened to me too in P-Tux's quest!
uhirjnskfgdbrfnzkdteshdnytj

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:11

and you werent doing
ANYTHING
🙂
so the ZC being running thing is just a fluke

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:14

but it also has to be *happening* in zc
if it happens to them in ZC without saving the quest again in ZQ

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:14

erm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:14

it means it has to be a shared file
Okay, so I'm gonna break this specific value and let it rot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:15

zoria's added holdspr, you mean?
smart

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:15

this time it happened within a minute of loading zq

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:15

frankly, tim
I have a feeling it happens when you open the dialog

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:15

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "zoria's added holdspr, you me…"): nah, the holdspr that's breaking

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:15

???

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:16

yeah its def

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:16

As in I'm gonna let it sit and it'll alert me when it changes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:16

Just remove something that's been fine for a decade, instead of the new thing that probably broke it?

It has to be a similar issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:22

frankly, patch that, and then we see if the issue even still occurs
should just need to resize your `oldHoldSpr` and the memcpy sizes
also, for fucks sake
`2*2*3*sizeof(int32_t)`?
Pretty sure you can just do `sizeof(holdspr)`

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) the dumb was me
```memcpy(sideswimholdspr, oldSideSwimHoldSpr, 4 * 3 * sizeof(int32_t));```
...That should be 3\*3, not 4*3

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:33

do it for you

eh, already commit the 3*3

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:34

that is, for the record, one of the differences between pointers and arrays
while you can use an array as a pointer in any circumstance
`sizeof()` on an array will give you the full array's size
`sizeof()` on a pointer gives you the size of... the pointer, not what it points to.

this quest uses the "swap boss and non-boss fireball status" EWeapon script included with 2.55
you start with the mirror shield
screen 1 has a gleeok, screen 2 has an aquamentus, and screen 3 has both
the desired behaviour is that the gleeok's shots should reflect, while the aquamentus' do not
because the script is supposed to swap their boss/non-boss fireball status
oh so let's see here...
the gleeok is working on both screens
however, the aquamentus' fireballs are always reflectable even though they SHOULD be boss fireballs and the mirror shield does not reflect/block those

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 21:02

ok this is extremely weird

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 21:03

in THIS quest, i have added a gohma 3 to the 4th screen. its fireballs are swapped. i have changed the mirror shield flags to 8 for both block and reflect - reflect small fireballs ONLY. this still has the issue of the aquamentus fireballs being reflectable
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/927665407760924692/927668487307026482/eweaponswap2.qst
(warning buggy quest)
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/927665407760924692/927668538238447686/typeb2.qst
however in THIS quest, the mirror shield is set to the exact same thing, the gohma is set to the exact same script, yet its fireballs are NOT blockable
(use cheat 4 to give yourself a mirror shield)
i have absolutely no idea what the difference is - i just cloned the gohma 3 enemy in my quest and gave it that eweapon script
should be identical to the gohma 3 in eweaponswap2.qst except for enemy # id

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:29

ok so issue here is that this script turns boss fireballs into normal fireballs (Gohma/Gleeok), but not vice versa (Aquamentus)
maybe i should just have two scripts, one that forces the fireball to be non-boss, and one that forces it to be boss, instead of the singular "toggle" script?
i'd be completely fine with that - no difference in gameplay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:30

The script isn't a toggle
It's based on the initd[0]
... you just left the initd at `0`, didn't you? @ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:34

Oh god damnit.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:34

lmfao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:34

It helps to actually look at how the literally 2-line script is set up...
the script is literally this:```cpp
eweapon script toggleBossFireball
{
    void run(bool enable)
    {
        if ( enable ) this->Level |= 1;
        else this->Level &= ~1;
    }
}```

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:35

I mean

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:35

So 0 InitD0 for an enemy = normal fireball, 1 InitD0 for boss?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:35

That isn't commented
at all

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:35

yeah i am seeing nothing there that refers to the enemy's weapon's InitD0 variable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:35

`void run(bool enable)`??

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:36

And what exactly the level is doing isn't immediately clear unless you're familiar with A: what bitwise looks like in code, and B: whether or not having a Level gives the boss fireball status or not

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:36

Oh I figured the Level set the status.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:36

You have a parameter `bool enable`
If it's true it's enabled
If it's false it's disabled

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:36

what is enabled? boss status being unset is enabled, or boss status being set is enabled?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:36

If you don't set it.....
Boss status enabled

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:37

Like, it's obvious for you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:37

Why would enabled disable the boss fireball?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:37

because you have the general "oh, this is how it works" figuring out knowledge

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:37

I figured because it was named "Toggle" that it flipped the boss fireball flag. So for Aquamentus it would give him boss fireballs, and for Gohma it would give her normal fireballs.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:37

The script name is "toggleBossFireball"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:37

Aye, probably a poor name

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:37

Like it would make them the opposite of normal.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:38

You're trying to argue smarts when most people default to unknowledgeable @EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:38

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:38

Also ^

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:38

And I did read the script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:38

But regardless, the fact that `void run()` has a parameter means you have initd to set up
That's zscript 101

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:39

```if ( enable ) this->Level |= 1;
        else this->Level &= ~1;```
I read "if this weapon's level is unequal to 1 (so a boss fireball), change it to 1 (a normal fireball), and else (meaning it IS 1), add 1 to the weapon's level (to make it 2, a boss fireball)"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:39

```eweapon script toggleBossFireball
{
    void run()
    {
        this->Level ^= 1;
    }
}```
This would actually toggle it
er
there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:39

Aye

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:39

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:41

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "```if ( enable ) this->Level…"): The thing here is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:41

Its `if(enable)`

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:41

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "```eweapon script toggleBossF…"): Ok so I can use this script as I was misusing the prior script? It just toggles it like a light switch?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:41

So whatever `enable` is (here, InitD[0]) is the condition

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:41

Should be able to, yeah

@ P-Tux7 also, helpful trick for future script debugging
``Trace(3);`` or etc

And yeah
could put a variable in there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:43

`Trace(this->Level)`
`TraceB(enable)`
The `B` is for boolean, it'll print `true` or `false`

=== @ vlamart 01/05/2022 20:11

Such as "Skip Combo Cycle on screen init" flag per individual combo, negative numbers for animations (going backwards in the tileset), and maybe even "Something->Previous" equivalents of "Something->Next" flags and types

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:12

I think Skip Combo Cycle on screen init should be a combo attribute, same for Secrets -> Next. Though of course the combo flag for Secrets -> Next can stay for specific use
We're trying to bake these into the combos for the REDUX and LTTP tilesets so that the user doesn't have to faff about with screen secret tiles for every single screen like they did in 2.50 and below.

=== @ vlamart 01/05/2022 20:14

I agree, it would be much easier to deal with most secrets this way

=== @ vlamart 01/05/2022 20:30

Maybe even moving or adding "generic->next" to an independent per combo "(trigger tab flags)->next" and "->pervious" flag or attribute?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 22:56

so `->Next`/`->Prev` was done awhile ago
`Secrets->Next` can just be... an inherent flag.

A suggestion for them to have attributes to refill a certain amount of Rupees, Bombs, Super Bombs, and Arrows you set when Link collects them. I actually already thought you could do that, which is why I included winged sprites for said items in Cambria a la Link's Awakening.

BS Zelda Ancient Stone Tablets had a potion type (gold) that refilled life, magic, bombs, and arrows. So that could still be of use eventually. Though no rush of course

none of them are set to stay dead

James is gonna love that
Also, if you're designing for James, I find from the design of his games that he enjoys a sort of metroidvania progression to his type B quests
(assuming he makes his own games tailor made for his own enjoyment)
You'll want to have the player interweaving in and out of different dungeons instead of having them commit to a single dungeon
But you'll also want to make it abundantly clear; James has NPCs outright tell you when to leave a dungeon and go to another
Or he'll make it clear when he wants you to explore
He doesn't want to be stuck figuring out where to go, but I think he likes doing things in a weird, interconnected way
That's just an assumption thouhg

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2022 18:30

you'll also notice something in my upcoming demo that i put in that he also liked

All module-based quests were being offset by 1
so everything was fucked up
I've done several things here
-Fixed default quest offset
-Fixed skip name offset
-If a module has 0 quests in it, then instead of loading a 1st.qst, no quest will be loaded for that slot upon creation. Trying to load a slot with no quest produces a special error:

=== @ Alucard648 01/06/2022 11:00

Because the way ZC determines rotation axis for scripted draws is non-understandable bonkers. People had to resort to use bitmaps to do this.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 11:00

. . . ?
you provide a center point `cx, cy` to be the center of most draws
I wouldn't THINK it would be that hard to use.... but then again I pretty much never use rotation, so
gonna need to know what it is you want changed here though; which needs to include how it works now vs what is specifically wrong with that

=== @ Alucard648 01/06/2022 11:23

```ffc script RotTest2{
    void run(){
        int origdata = this->Data;
        this->Data = 1;
        int cmb = ComboAt(this->X+8, this->Y+8);
        int w = this->TileWidth;
        int h = this->TileHeight;
        int cx = ComboX(cmb)+8;
        int cy = ComboY(cmb)+8;
        int counter = 0;
        while(true){
            counter++;
            Screen->DrawCombo(2, this->X, this->Y, origdata, w, h, this->CSet, -1, -1, cx, cy, counter, 0, 0, true, OP_OPAQUE);

        }
    }
}```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 11:24

Err, I think you want `this->X+8` not `ComboX(cmb)+8`
Because `this->X` is the draw x
Not `ComboX(cmb)`

=== @ Alucard648 01/06/2022 11:31

This script should cause left FFC to rotate  around solid combo in this test quest. The right FFC is desired result, achieved using bitmaps.

If using a Lens of Truth close enough to the signpost and in one of the directions it can be talked to in, the message is displayed. One would presumably set the signpost to accept no buttons for input, or if that's impossible, then the flag would disable button reading of the signpost combo.

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "If using a Lens of Truth clos…"): To be frank here, the simplest way to implement this is with string control codes. Just have it jump to the real message if you have the lens, or `mask of truth`, or whatever item you want it to be; and a default message otherwise.
Using the lens to trigger it feels a little jank to me, honestly; I'd want a gossip stone to work just like a sign for triggering
and with SCCs you can already make that work

=== @ 4matsy 01/07/2022 00:58

You know how, at first, the tile editor's mode of using the shift key to select multiple tiles allows you to select a box-shaped formation of tiles?

Well, if you press space to change that to the line-by-line selection mode, the cursor will usually disappear, leaving you to use the tile preview in the bottom left corner to guess where your current position is. 😬 

Upon further testing on tile page 0, the cause of the bug might have been found: it seems that the cursor is simply being drawn at position (column number, tile number) instead of (column number, row number). 🤷‍♂️

@ NightmareJames ran into this one during the recent stream of HeroOfFire's 4th quest. I checked ZC's 1st.qst on a hunch, and the bug happens there too.

It's easiest to see on the screens with the red leevers a few screens to the right of the starting point. Get the wooden sword, then head right a few screens until you reach the coast screens with the red leevers. With any luck, one of them - that isn't the last one 😒 - will drop a clock, and you can see the bug in action. The leevers just keep right on moving despite the clock being picked up.

When Zoria changed the Slash->Next behavior, it introduced a second bug where slash combo behavior is taking priority over secret triggers. So if I put a sword trigger on a bush combo, it will switch to its slashed combo instead of the one for the secret and will not trigger the secret until you slash it again. This is not the same thing as `Old Slash Combo Secret Flag Behavior`, so please don't dismiss it as such. There's something funky going on here still.

=== @ Moosh 01/07/2022 06:51

Here's an example quest with two bushes, one using the sword and the other also able to be triggered by the wand. The sword bush works correctly with `Old Slash Combo Secret Flag Behavior` checked but has the double slash issue with it off. Interestingly with the compat flag it appears to use properties of both triggers as it plays the secret sound and uses the secret combo but also produces bush leaves as if it were slashed. Ideal.
On the wand screen, the wand trigger always takes priority over the slash trigger, regardless of if the compat rule is checked or not. That one just works
Interestingly the wand trigger also creates bush leaves but only if the magic weapon was created on top of it.

=== @ Moosh 01/07/2022 06:56

small update also adding a hammer trigger and a strike trigger for reference
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/928902857648930816/928904805097816084/SlashNextSecretPriority.qst
The hammer trigger has the secret take priority when struck. The strike trigger has the bush take priority when hit with the sword

=== @ Moosh 01/07/2022 07:09

Another inconsistency with trigger priority that I'm not sure if can be addressed: A magic wand shot hitting a Block All or Block Magic combo with a magic trigger on it will trigger secrets when hit from the west or north end, but eat the weapon when hit from the south or east. WEW

=== @ Moosh 01/07/2022 07:11

This above interaction may or may not be involved in an emulation setting. I got softlocked in Zelda's Butt due to the above issue and reported it to Zoria multiple times. I have no clue if he ever addressed it, betting no

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2022 20:37

Sorry for the delay

Thanks Deedee.

=== @ Moosh 01/18/2022 00:49

Also since P-Tux pointed out it existed, I checked the quest report and it does seem to report flag 79 as a "bugged" flag placement, so I guess Zoria intended it to work this way. Though it does also report 76 and that one still works the old way

A supplementary QR to the Z1 bosses can spawn anywhere QR where if they are not told to spawn somewhere using an enemy flag, they spawn at their Z1/2.50 location instead of randomly. It's impossible to "manually place" a few enemies in the correct place such as Gleeoks using combo flags
I think this applies to
-Aquamentus left/right
-Manhandla?
-Gleeok
-Gohma
-Ganon
-Zora
-Boulders?
-Moldorm
-Lanmola
-NOT traps because i'm pretty sure their "hardcoded" spawn location would be 0,0

Gleeoks you can using the "Center X rule" or whatever it's called, but it needs to be applied on ALL the bosses, not just Gleeoks.  Gohmas are off-center too among other guilty parties

Starting in Alpha 100, during the very first opening wipe after starting ZC some extra pixels are drawn. Upon closer look, they appear to be based off of misc colors. They disappear as soon as the opening wipe ends and will not be drawn again until you close and reopen ZC.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 19:15

Sadly this seems to be one of those crashes that seems to happen randomly, but it's happened twice in two different recent builds in different quests, but the one thing in common was I touched a Cave (Walk Down) combo when the hard crash occurred.
My guess is this is something position based, or maybe something in the code is reading random memory (which is why it doesn't always crash).

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 19:16

I have not experienced this crash in older builds (92 and older), and I do recall an earlier build that had other random ZC crashes, so maybe it's related?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 19:18

For point of reference, the crash has occurred in 99 and 101.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/11/2022 19:51

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) these alphas were post entrance warp fix, right?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 20:21

Wait, wasn't the broken cave warps 100 though?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 20:26

Meanwhile I forget if it was 97 or 99 that had other crashing bugs (I want to say one happened often on screens with Gleeok?), which got fixed by 100.
When it happened in 99, it was pretty early in a quest so I could get back to the specific screen to see if I could reproduce it, but couldn't. Wasn't sure if it then got fixed along with the other crashes.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 20:28

If it helps, the crash happens before the first frame of the "going down the cave" effect. The SFX does not get a chance to play, and I don't think Link is even drawn under the cave combo yet.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/11/2022 22:01

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Wait, wasn't the broken cave…"): 100 was broken caves yeah
101 is post broken caves

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 22:05

So this crash is unrelated to that bug / fix.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/11/2022 22:32

Possibly...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/12/2022 02:46

I'd put it in the `LinkClass::dowarp()` section as a likely bugged area, though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 14:40

@ HeroOfFireZC could you give me some example quests of where this occurs?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:36

It's happened in my own quests (I usually play them first in a new build)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:37

Happened in Mirage Island after an hours, and Turtles Hate Candy after 15 minutes. And if you recall, Mirage Island is a 256 screen overworld with a ton of caves, so the fact it only crashed entering a cave after an hour and not the first 5 or so is annoying to pin down.
On the other hand, has *not* crashed testing DDD, which has *zero* Walk Up/Down caves.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 17:38

hmmm
might need to hook up a debugger and play around for a bit until a crash happens
not the *worst*, as long as that crash eventually happens

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:39

Also, this was fairy recent. In a prior build I was playing through some older randos (also cave happy), and had zero crashes there.
Actually, hold on, let me see if I can confirm those versions (though if this is super random, those versions may still have this bug)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:42

Okay, first off, the first crash was in Alpha 99, Build 61
Oh, that number means nothing for nightlys....
Uh, so, the version with 16+ hours of gameplay an no crashes was Nov 14 build.
Wait....
The first crashing build was Oct 21. *Before* that other build.
And then the 101 build with the other crash Jan 9.
So I guess I got *really* lucky in that Nov 14 build?
Let me glance at one other thing here quick....

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:47

Okay, has nothing to do with the entrance type, both cases were different warp types.
(was wondering if the reason I dodged it in that one version was having a lot of generic screen 80 caves)
(and if both cases were a specific type, like Entrance / Exit or something)
So..... where does this leave this. Seems like something involving random memory, given how inconsistent it is.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 17:49

latest version of mirageisland off Pure?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:49

Yep.
I think Turtles is the same, that one was the Level 2 entrance, which made be briefly think it had to do with screen secrets spawning the cave hitbox over me, but that does not seem to be the case.
Since that one was so early in the quest, I actually started the run over, saved when I could access that cave entrance, and tried entering it differently several times, no crashes.
But then again, all the caves in Mirage Island are the Z1 style, it's nearly impossible to approach those combos from a weird angle anyways.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:53

Right now this just appears to be very random chance, I wonder if it can happen in *any* quest or if there is some specific rule tripping it.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 18:08

One thing I can think of these quests have in common, both were last saved in 2.52. I doubt that is the cause, but just in case...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 22:19

4 hours and I have yet to crash
I'm hoping I either fixed the bug, or I run into the crash sooner rather than later

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 11:03

finished a run, no crash

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2022 16:42

Given what was discussed, and how I had about 10+ hours between two randos with plenty of caves with no crashes, yet clearly in a version that exists between the two I have encountered the crash in, it does seem very random.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 16:43

@ HeroOfFireZC if you run into it in the upcoming alpha, let me know

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2022 16:43

But looking at the code related to caves, there doesn't seem to be any clear issue?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 16:43

I'll probably start testing in older versions
If I can recreate it there, I might be able to figure out if it's a thing we fixed or not

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2022 16:47

Just trying to figure out how to narrow down the issue. It's  Hard Crash, so that should limit it to certain kinds of issues. It's really random, so random memory access seems like the most likely cause.
The last hard crash bad memory access issue was a thing in zQuest where the "hitbox" for color replacing was a bit too large, letting you go out of bounds of an array.
Which meant how consistent it was had to do with a combination of zQuest version and my comp, others could have done the same thing and not seemed to crash.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2022 16:51

I guess one thing to look at. If you have an idea what code is being called the first frame you touch a walk-down cave combo, compare it between current versions and earlier alphas, like 92. See if anything has changed.
(I have used and played on 92 for a *long* time with no crashes, so it seems safe to assume the crash was introduced since then)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 16:53

so it's specifically the first frame that causes the crash?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2022 16:55

It seems to be. I don't hear the stepping SFX or see LInk drawn below the combo, but the crash happened when really close to a cave, most likely when touching it that the next frame would have me performing the cave entering state.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:00

@ HeroOfFireZC new alpha is out; please let me know if you run into the crash again in the alpha

I'm not sure if this was implemented, as I did ask about it before but lost track of it. Is it possible to add a flag that always makes you face a certain way when on a combo? This would make it so climbing ladders on mountains (etc) would look more accurate.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/14/2022 03:51

this'd need to be a new combo type

=== @ Jared 01/14/2022 04:14

Oh okay

=== @ vlamart 01/14/2022 05:32

Idea: combine this with slow walk and use attributes for step speed, direction (0 or something for being not a fixed direction), and LTM (for climbing animation should quest maker choose)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/14/2022 14:09

you mean non sideview right?
there's a QR to make you always face up on sideview ladders
oh yeah both slow walk and sideview ladders would benefit from settable speed

for all his assholery james24 had a good idea combining floors that made you move fast with just as fast enemies

## ✅🔒Enlarged Enemies drop item at lowest right tile, not Hitbox Offset (#1161)

=== @ Zaidyer 01/16/2022 14:37

When an enemy is set to use TileWidth and TileHeight greater than 1, the drop location will always be based on the lowest rightmost tile, not the enemy's actual HitX/HitY location.

=== @ Zaidyer 01/16/2022 16:08

However: "Enemy Carries Item" *does* respect the enemy's actual hitbox and will follow the enemy and drop as expected.
It seems only the spawned-in item drops are affected by this bug.

weird...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 00:48

Okay, that's actually really weird
cause for me, the carried item is held at the topleft position
but the spawned item drop is at the center, where it's supposed to be

(meta) thread name was changed: 🔓Enlarged Enemies drop item at lowest right tile, not Hitbox Offset

=== @ Zaidyer 02/07/2022 17:21

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "cause for me, the carried ite…"): Top left of the “tile” bounding box. It should be based on the enemy’s actual hitbox offsets, not its tiles. I have my enemy’s hitbox unchanged, meaning it’s in the top left of its tile box. But I adjusted its graphical offsets to center the visible sprite on the hitbox.
Ergo, carried items look correct because the hitbox and topleft of the tilebox agree, but dropped items try to center themselves based on the tile box, which is way past where I have the hitbox.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 21:24

@ Zaidyer okay, to clarify: you want dropped items to be in the center of their hitwidth and hitheight based off hitoffsets?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 21:26

I can make a Quest Rule for this behavior; I don't want to break older quests that might try and move the drops manually

=== @ Zaidyer 02/07/2022 21:53

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@ Zaidyer okay,…"): yes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 08:55

Okay, added two QR's, one in compat rules for fixing enemies carrying items, and one in enemy rules for making it so dropped items (and carried items if the former is checked) use the hitbox instead of the tile

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 08:58

There should be a list of numbers denoting what layer different objects appear on, including their default. The reason being is that I am faced with the troublesome task of putting "held items" on the highest visible layer available. If there were a list of layers things will generally appear on(in different states, if necessary) I wont have to write such garbagey and hard to maintain scripts. Thank you.

In Screen flags 1, you can have an option to have the lens either reveal or hide a layer. If set to "reveal" a layer, the layer will be hidden by default and will only be revealed by using the lens. If set to "hide" a layer, the layer will draw *unless* you use the lens, in which case it won't.

Yes, I'm talking about Goriyas. Probably shouldn't apply to the Goriya 3/Rapid-Fire shooting style because it IS rapid-fire and other enemies that use it, such as Death Knights, don't halt
(If added, a row of tiles for halting should be added to both the Goriya 1 and 2 New Enemy Tiles where there was previously a blank row)

=== @ 4matsy 01/21/2022 03:57

The reason the row was removed in the first place is because they don't wait for a short bit after halting before firing in the NES game.
(They don't wait to finish moving onto the next tile like they do in ZC, either - they can fire whenever they feel like it, and even turn in whatever directions they're able to. Normally this just means backwards, but this can include to the sides if they happen to be on a 16x16 grid intersection.)

This rule should also affect 2-frame, 3-frame and 4-frame animations.

Like the screen flag, but for a combo itself. Saves the end user work when using tilesets that have these combos set up properly. I intend to use it in the LTTP tileset for one-time-only animations (opening Misery Mire's main entrance, Skull Woods' final entrance, Ganon's Tower stairs lowering, the lightning bat blocking Hyrule Tower's steeple...) and REDUX tileset will probably appreciate it too for using those same LTTP tiles.

The idea is to have a new fountain function that you can toss item/weapons into a pond and it upgrades them using a fairy in a wiseman room. You have a Text choice selection option, and everything seen in this video, is exactly how it would work but done in Zelda Classic.  It would be a mock-up of this system into ZC engine, but simpler. You have a Upgrade List in - Misc Data>  Weapon Upgrades, where you can set up 'what item' upgrades into what other item manually in the editor.   Video Example is below:  Basically you can make it update up to 9 times at least of an item each. Lastly the Fairy over the fountain does not have to be a giant fairy, just a single tile size NES Fairy.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/23/2022 00:07

Okay so you know how nowadays Keese Tribbles tribble into Vire Tribbles and Gel Tribbles tribble into Zol Tribbles. That should not happen in 1.90.
In 1.90, keese tribbles should tribble into regular (blue) vires and gel tribbles should tribble into regular zols. use this quest
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/934600282640359424/934600420649762836/TRIBBLES.QST
if the keese tribble turns into a blue vire, that's good
as for the gel/zol tribbles, since they look identical to normal ones in 1.90 quests, we'll have to do a little detective work
type "zelda" and give yourself the white sword. if the zol that the gel tribble turns into is killable with the white sword, that's good because it is a regular zol as it should be. if it splits again, it's bad because it is a zol tribble as it should not be in 1.90
(this quest was saved in 1.90. use it as a reference for how 1.90 tribbles act when running 1.90 quests in modern zc)

Not a big deal, but it was quite possible in all versions of ZC prior to 2.50. I'm not sure which 2.50 beta changed this, sorry, but I can confirm it happens in 2.10.

Can you make a video showing this?  According to LoZ canon, this should not be possible.

        sfx(WAV_EHIT,pan(int(x)));

=== @ P-Tux7 01/23/2022 00:29

By standalone I mean Digdogger Kids 1-4 that you place in the room. And Gohmas 3 and 4 only, not Red and Blue. This is also in reference to the normal enemy respawn system - they will not respawn if they are in a boss room, of course. But if you place them outside of one, they will respawn.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/934605649562710056/934605675265417266/enemyrespawn.qst
(Ignore the Patras - they should not respawn in either version, I was just checking them)
I know this behaviour dates back to 1.92 as well, but I wonder if more enemies respawn in that version so I will have to check. I recall that Patra 3s were not on the Do Not Respawn list in the B114 source code.

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2022 21:07

I've got no idea how remotely feasible this is, but I had a dream it got added in a new build and it was really cool. The idea would be an option in ZQuest that launches ZC in a special test play mode where:
-The title screen and file select are skipped
-All forms of saving do nothing and retry closes the program. Nothing writes to zc.sav
-Level 4 cheat is on by default
-Link spawns on the current screen viewed in ZQuest, either using a Test Play DMap specified in init data or the first valid DMap using the current map and palette
This would be invaluable for both testing individual screen setups in dungeons and making small script test quests that don't need long term saves

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2022 21:08

This.... sounds fancy as shit
There are other fancy things higher than this on the list, though
....perhaps when I have time to look into it....

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2022 21:08

Fair enough. I think the new launcher followed me into my dreams xD

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2022 21:09

One of the big things is, anything to do with how the new launcher creates processes, won't work at all on linux, I'm pretty sure
. . . actually looking at getting a linux VM set up now....

=== @ cbailey78 01/25/2022 02:19

I remember way back in 2003 or 2004 that it had a "Test" in the file menu at one time but crashed the program and didn't work, so it got taken out.

=== @ mitchfork 01/25/2022 03:20

yeah this would be excellent
even if it didn't start you on the current screen and just quick launched the quest w/ no save file that would be huge for script testing

=== @ cbailey78 01/25/2022 04:58

I would recommend it to start you on the screen zquest is on or give you an option to start at the Dmap continue point.

=== @ bigjoe 01/26/2022 10:55

this was actually a feature that Dark Nation(third ZC Dev)  wanted to add at some point, but never got around to.

=== @ bigjoe 01/26/2022 11:27

either way, this idea reeks of perfection. please consider. Constantly opening ZC and skipping the title is getting old

=== @ cbailey78 01/26/2022 17:56

(replying to @ bigjoe "either way, this idea reeks o…"): Ditto!  Especially making large quests involving scripting debugging if an issue arises causing you to go back and forth testing.

Appear to have this much working
So, command-line setup for `-test "quest_file" start_dmap start_screen`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 11:10

if you ever try to exit to the title screen, it just reloads the quest
if you save, it *does* save, but not to any file
after saving, any 'reload' of the quest will load that save, until you exit the program, at which point the save data is discarded
cheat level 4 is automatically enabled

It pre-fills `Start Screen` with the current screen, and `Start DMap` with the first dmap that matches the current map (going to make it tiebreak with palette next)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 12:16

k, now it should prioritize a dmap that has the correct palette and map over just the first to match the map
but of course you can override it to whatever dmap you want in the dialog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 12:19

also adding favorite command `Test Quest`
also, if you try to test when you have unsaved changes....
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935279555994869832/940944977482108948/unknown.png)
And if you try to test on a quest that has *never* been saved, it does yet another different thing; in that case, it just opens the `Save As` dialog. If you don't save, it won't let you test, as there's no quest file *to* open.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 12:23

fancy!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 12:25

For the record, basically what it does
is the same as when you make a new save file for the quest
except, it overrides the zinit continue dmap / screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 12:33

Also, if you try to run a test while a previous test is open, it will kill the old test process (though it won't kill any console attached to the test process, and not much I can do about that)

Does it have a boolean for reading if it's in test play mode in ZScript? Forget if I mentioned that idea but sounds like it'd be simple. And remove the need for `const bool DEBUG` 😄

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 12:58

Okay, trying out the test play on my existing quest appears to have given the global script a stroke. It did a bunch of messed up stuff seemingly indicating a corrupted global array

running it by launching ZC the old way still works though, seemingly

As does launching from the blank save slot that was apparently generated by the test play session (that one sounds like a bug)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:01

Oh???? It modified the save file?
Uhhh
WTF

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:02

Created one to be precise. I ran it on a fresh install, gonna test if it can overwrite existing saves

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:02

Which I guess if my global array is invalid would check out. It's doing this
`if(G[G_LASTSCREEN]!=Game->GetCurScreen()||G[G_LASTDMAP]!=Game->GetCurDMap()){`
So it thinks the screen is changing every frame presumably because G doesn't exist

It's working!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:04

So, the global `Quit` value was fucked
and depending on config files (because random memory happened to overlap with something config related)
it had an error quitstate during init
thus, `run_script`?
```cpp
int32_t run_script(const byte type, const word script, const int32_t i)
{
    if(Quit==qRESET || Quit==qEXIT) // In case an earlier script hung
        return RUNSCRIPT_ERROR;```
well, that was instantly returning
because it happened to be one of those two values
so the init script never ran
but THEN `Quit` was cleared, and the rest of everything proceeded normally
just had to clear it a tad earlier

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:06

I see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:06

oh
actually
it had to be `qRESET` specifically
it was probably `qEXIT` before, when it was opening and instantly exiting
because that would skip the main loop *entirely*
and when you launched it normally, it wrote something to a config file
which changed the random memory
thus changing the value to `qRESET`
which, now could launch, but still broke the init script
fucks sake memory issues are terrible

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:12

This is actual magic playing around with this thing. Just picking out random screens in the quest and going there instantly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:12

also, the save now is named `Hero`
(it was blank before, as you noted when it was overwriting zc.sav)

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:13

For quests that access the filename for strings I assume. That's pretty smart

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:14

Scripts can overwrite it custom easily enough, too
```cpp
global script Init
{
    void run()
    {
        if(Debug->Testing) Game->SetName("FooBar");
    }
}```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:16

Yuurand uses it for automatic character selection
MM2D used it to enable debug mode
(Or rather, *disable* debug mode)
(any file named `Link` started with only the basic inventory, while any other file started with everything)

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:17

Nah, I mean _writing_ to the name. Plenty of quests read it

## Limited directional statue shooters. (#1183)

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 01/26/2022 10:27

An ability to limit the direction that statue shooters of any sort can actually detect the player.  I.e.  if Right-facing statues have an invisible internal line passing through that statue dividing the screen up and down where it can only detect the player if it's to the right of that line. 

Perhaps the new green "Effect" clickable quadrant squares can determine where that is?  So a full green square will detect the player anywhere, but a green square with only its bottom half green will detect the player only anywhere below it?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/26/2022 14:08

I think this should be enemy settings and you can just define an enemy for the statue to spawn

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 01/26/2022 14:48

Even in a room where all ten enemy slots are occupied by other non-shooter enemies?
Where defeating the enemies could possibly turn off those statues via a flag of some sort?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/26/2022 23:05

(replying to @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty "Even in a room where all ten…"): Yeah, the *combo* would spawn the enemy as it does with normal shooting statues, it wouldn't be in an enemy slot
(replying to @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty "Where defeating the enemies c…"): And I have actually requested this too as a screen flag

A combo that starts walkable and pushes player off (speed fixed to walkspeed and dir in attributes), then takes A.Frame and pauses on the last frame and become fully solid. Reacts to either secrets or screen states (flagged, specified by attributes, marking neither flag makes it a permanent shutter), by reversing the animation and becoming walkable with no push. Additional flag for if the push closing and opening animation replays everytime you reenter or just once

In 1.92 and 2.10 quests that have the quest rule "Rope 2s Don't Flash" enabled, the Rope 2s should use CSet 9 instead of 8. A few graphical problems with them due to this in Dreams of Yesterday, and in The Islands of Zelda, it's impossible to tell them apart from Rope 1s due to this. I think To the Top has the same issue?

You have to make a new save file for the quest icons to change. They don't change even when you change them in the quest they are permanently loaded in ZC for that one save file. If you make a new save file and cheat to give yourself a ring and then save, that save file will show the updated icon because it was created after you changed it in the quest.

And it only stops doing this if i close the player and start it back up again.

But eventually does this again if i minimize it and do full screen again.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 07:04

placeholder to describe later basically but the additional animations from Z3 that make sense in ZC's context

-death faceplant
-hurt
-boomerang toss
-pound animation for wands and staves (neither of these had melee damage in Z3 if that simplifies things)

todo: port over frame data from bug thread and elaborate on/research relative positions of boomerang and death bonk, as well as spinning bug net frame data

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 07:06

these animations also make sense in a ZC context, but have their own cans of worms
-push: some things in LTTP don't show the push animation (so it's FAR more than just a combo type+solidity check and would likely need to be an all-combos flag a la hookability), and the pushing scripts that are on the database look silly while letting you move while pushing
-sword tap - same animation concept. you couldn't move while doing it in LTTP. though this may prove to be easier due to no combo fuckery involved

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 07:09

admittedly the sword tap is also a big priority (see: deafness improvements thread)

What it says on the tin really. Similar to the Darknut "NES Fix", this is to stop the illusion that one is doing anything effective when hitting the core. Though as it is audio-only instead of visual as well, this is low-priority IMO.

I was thinking there needs to be Keyboard Key shortcuts for certain mouse features in 2.55 Alpha, such as -Select Combo needs a Letter Key shortcut, Scroll to combo, Edit Combo and Replace All need single Key Shortcuts.

These choices appear when you Press the right mouse button.
It would make work faster if those commands had keys.

it can be very tiring to the fingers is why.*

Once cheats are on, you can decrease the cheat level by entering a lower level cheat, but there's afaik no way to go from cheat level 1 to 0, barring scripts. Would be neat if entering an invalid code did it, or an option in the dropdown

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2022 15:59

Pfft
The dev menu actually can do this already
(Because you just enter any number 0-4 to force cheat level)
I could probably make a menu that let's you do the same, up to the max level code you've entered?
Or, better yet, revamp the cheat dialog entirely

=== @ Moosh 02/15/2022 16:02

Could be cool. So long as hotkeys remain the same. F11, H, G, and the layer disabling ones are my lifeblood
But a lot of the time I'll use cheats to give myself some items and the only way to turn it off again is to F6 save, which isn't always ideal
hence the request

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2022 16:05

I'm thinking, a box to type code in, with a check button
And a radiolist of 0,1,2,3,4
Grey out the radio buttons higher than the highest code checked
Give ZScript access as `Game->MaxCheat`, probably?

=== @ Moosh 02/15/2022 16:07

This makes sense, though I wonder if quests would use it
back in the day when quests occasionally gave out lower level cheats I wondered why it wasn't more customizable. Now it seems to be L4, quest password, or nothing

=== @ Moosh 02/16/2022 00:10

How does it function with reading/setting cheats via script? Returns the currently selected radio button?
Would writing cheat level 4 also update the max cheat?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 00:11

Reading `Game->Cheat` gives the selected
If you write it higher than max cheat, max cheat matches
If you write max cheat under cheat, it pulls cheat down

=== @ Moosh 02/16/2022 00:12

eeexcellent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 00:13

The "cheats used" state of the save file is set as soon as Cheat is >0
Max cheat does *not* affect this
So even if you enter a cheat code, as long as you leave it on level 0, it won't mark you as having used cheats.

Reported by obake-san for Splitting Darknuts in 2.10, but I imagine it extends to other splitting enemies. 

What SHOULD happen: One of the Blue Darknuts inherits the Ringleader status. When killed, all other enemies die.
What happens currently: Neither Blue Darknut inherits it and when killed, all other enemies do NOT die

Was used in a similar situation as the Armageddon Quest room with a Lanmola and Phantom Ghinis where you had to kill the Splitting Darknut to kill all the Ghinis.

Bizarrely, I could have sworn that splitting a Splitting Darknut in 2.50 counts as killing it for ringleader purposes...? I have a lot to check...

=== @ bigjoe 02/16/2022 01:41

Basically, this would be a fifth cheat level that tracks whatever items you have when you first enter a dmap. Then, when you use the Goto menu box, you can select a checkbox "Reacquire Entry Items" or "Reacquire Exit Items". The data for this would be saved in a file alongside the quest. The reason for this is that some quests offer complex possibilities as to what you can have upon entering/exiting a dmap, and resetting this via the player data menu over and over can get tedious. This would be the next good step to streamlined debugging after Test Screen.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 01:41

This is a bit complex for engine cheats
you could do this with a script, though

have a global variable that detects if you have a dummy item (or level item)

It's not out of the question, given that I did something kinda similar with palette expansion

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:40

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) , what exactly is the issue exactly expanding save file slots?  RAM usage?  Crashes?  All of the above?

Hrmmmmmmm

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:43

This is a known feature request and should be physically possible, if there any way it can be started with one addition then move on, or am I completely wrong on that?
I certainly know file stream stuff can be very tricky

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:44

Like
This needs a full rewrite of how saves work
Which also, if you think about it
Means a rewrite of how the *save select* works
So, uh, it'll require a LOT of work
And it all has to be done at once
Because if you were to do any part of it without finishing, then well, you wouldn't be able to play any quests at all

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:45

@ HeroOfFireZC @<role: Tester> Please input on this thread your views but just to reiterate, this is not a "do it now" priority.  I'd like to see this done eventually
This RN is more of a roundtable discussion

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:55

My basic hope would be:
`saves/` folder to hold all save files
Dialog loader system, allowing loading any save file or making a new one
Save *file* name and character name separate, enter both on create new file.

Due to file system, it might take longer to load each save (as it would load from file each time you load, instead of only on launch). However, this would also mean crashing would no longer lose progress saved once you return to the menu, as it would write the data to file then.

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:56

Sounds reasonable
See how the general testing group feels about it, as I don't want to speak for everyone

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:57

This requires:
-rewriting a lot of save file code
- completely replacing the save select screen with a completely new dialog
Which, while only 2 bullet points, is a fucking lot

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:59

As I said, absolutely no rush

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 21:01

ZCL and the new testing feature should provide people with 99+ save slots for now

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/16/2022 21:04

Can you clarify what you mean by "load every time you load instead of launch"? What would this effect, and what would remain unchanged load-time wise. I assume it just means the file select menu and loading the quest is slower, so F6->Retry would be a bit slower, anything else?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/16/2022 21:06

Depending on the scope of this rewrite, this might not make sense a 2.55 feature. The question is, how much effort would a smaller improvement be? Namely number of save slots increased, and size of save file name increased?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 21:06

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Can you clarify what you mean…"): Yes
(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Depending on the scope of thi…"): You can already use multiple `.sav`s with zcl
Save name length will require the title screen rewrite

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/16/2022 21:11

Hmm... I'd say set this idea aside for now (or play around with it in a side build), and maybe consider attempting it when the 2.55 to-do list is smaller. This re-write sounds like a big commitment, and better focused on if there was a "stable" 2.55 build that didn't need updates for a good while.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 21:15

To be fair, we've done some fairly extensive rewrites of systems already
it just takes one of us having enough energy in a burst to plow through it

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 21:18

I'm in agreement, I'll just make a video on how to manip save files

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/16/2022 21:39

I don't recall where I've last seen this done, but I know there have been games with "experimental builds" that are dedicated to massive changes like this. That is one way I could see this happening "short term". I'm just concerned that working on it now could derail other development. This does not sound like a change you put into a nightly build and call it done, there will likely be weeks of testing.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/16/2022 21:42

It does sound worth doing at some point though, the question is when is a good time to put all the development and testing focus on it.

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 23:43

Moosh brought up an idea regarding this and the other tile editor bug that's stupid enough to probably be the reason
[8:46 PM] Moosh: I think what's happened is anything involving bitmaps in the editor is broken, because of that speed fix with drawing directly to the screen.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 01:53

. . . no
because that fix was in ZC
not ZQ

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 01:53

Huh...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 01:53

ZQ already had the intermediate bitmap, since 2.50.2 at least
I copied it *from* ZQ

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 01:53

Well whatever the issue, it wasn't there in November, and it's here now

https://tenor.com/view/the-simpsons-principal-skinner-skinner-children-out-of-touch-gif-4463952
Okay so the problem was that the old devs hardcoded something really stupid that I didn't catch when I updated the palette to have new stuff
So the main palette was sized 15 and level palettes sized 13 before
but this is all stored in one big array and there's no difference

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/17/2022 13:26

The old devs didn't offset by the main palette to access the level palettes; they just added 1 to the level palette you were accessing (adding another 13), then added 2 to every level specific cset
obviously this kinda breaks when you bump up level palettes from 13 to 17

A 103 seemed to break the code that was used to set controller abilities.  It outright crashes using ZC Launcher to ZC player and while it works on the Test Mode, it is very slow.  Using an XBox One Controller to test

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:16

*crashes*?
For FUCKS SAKE
why can't anything fucking work

Yes, basically just click it and it hangs there infinitely and you can't get out of it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:17

Ok so I noticed the 2.50 quest when played in 2.55 has the whole "hitting a boss makes the normal AND boss hurt sounds" thingy. This is not supposed to happen in Z1 and got corrected for 2.55 by default. However, for playing a 2.50 quest in 2.55, it's supposed to happen and is happening. Works great! 
However, re-saving a 2.50 quest in 2.55, it "fixes" that issue. Is that intentional...?

So, because testing this requires deleting a bunch of items
I uh, got very tired very quickly of doing `rclick->paste` repeatedly
so, now, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+L` activate the `Copy`, `Paste`, `Save` and `Load` options from the rclick menu
(needs the Ctrl because typing normally searches)

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/944047278027604038/944059193512587304/unknown.png)
Special handling case now displays this if no items are found
as, both the lister and the switcher full of checkboxes were *empty*
and thus when they reference their default option of `[0]`, they are uh, nullpo
so now, those gui objects just... don't exist at all if you don't have items

I found a small error where when you go to Test in ZQ, and it prompts you to save, but it keeps bringing you back to the save screen instead of the screen where you pick your location for testing.

You can press test but I think it should bring you to the actual screen, right?

=== @ Russ 02/18/2022 03:01

Can confirm. Saving the quest via this window does not actually appear to set whatever flag ZQuest uses to determine if it should display the prompt or not
Cancelling and re-selecting Test seems to fix it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:04

Not an error
this is a function-panel dialog
it, by design, presents you with multiple buttons, most of which run a function without closing the dialog

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:05

Ohhh okay. I kind of thought that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:05

(and, I can construct them with an arbitrary number of buttons, with arbitrary text, running arbitrary functions, so it's very easy to make dialogs with it)
This also occurs in at least one other place....
I think it's the popup when your global init script changes after a compile?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/19/2022 22:48

need a bit more info cause I'm not understanding what you mean
do you mean that Grass and Slash combos don't have a cutting sfx?

=== @ Jared 02/20/2022 03:06

The tall grass has the same walking sfx and slashing sfx

the combo editor field `Slash SFX`
is what sets it
which is blatantly dumbassed

it clearly is not like that in LTTP

A combo flag or a flag on the Switch Block combo that makes it "count" as a pushable block for block trigger purposes, but is un*push*able. It only serves to be swapped with and depress a block trigger.

=== @ Moosh 02/18/2022 23:32

So a Push (No Way) flag?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/18/2022 23:33

Basically

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 23:50

I... was about to say `doesn't this exist?`
but then I looked
and, it very clearly doesn't
I certainly *INTENDED* to have something for this....
A placeable flag is a fair bit of work to add
but, adding a flag on the SwitchHook Block combo type, should be easy enough

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2022 00:03

oh and please test to make sure that they can't be fail-hooked when on a block trigger
said friend was complaining about that when switch blocks were used with a pushblock flag
is that even a bug to report or intended?
i admittedly haven't used the real switch hook because i haven't played oracle of ages

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2022 00:06

That's intended
The combo is hookable, but it's locked in place

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2022 00:18

Makes sense
They called it ugly and I kind of agree but I AM having trouble thinking of a better way to communicate it

AKA after you've pushed them on all the triggers. Didn't categorize this one as while it may be technically more useful as a screen flag, that might be a waste and it could also be a QR
So basically you can keep pushing blocks over triggers until you've got all triggers covered.
Though if pushing a pushblock onto it "erases" the trigger like I heard it does... uh oh
Sorry this is just another friend request

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2022 01:32

It would erase the trigger if the block is on the same layer
Because, the block... is a combo
And the trigger... is a combo
So you can't have 2 combos on the same layer in the same position

I think, sound play on Screen->TriggerSecrets() call is excessive. Sometimes, you need silent secret triggering.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2022 06:32

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 00:56

Oh, forgot to update this thread
It now works fine on any combo type
and plays the screen secret sfx

For the LTTP tileset. A tile that you can set to be the item's representation on the active and passive subscreen instead of the tile of the sprite that you pick up/get from a chest.
Nothing fancy - just hijack the subscreen item draws with a non-animated tile. Doesn't even touch the subscreen editor.

(Okay, that code might need some updates to preview the item subscreen tiles... but that's all rendering. No new/modified subscreen elements or anything)

=== @ Moosh 02/19/2022 12:44

This happens when writing to a tempscreen for an invalid layer, as in one not assigned via the editor. A previous report saw this fixed so graphics get updated on the layer, but the combos still don't seem fully functional. If the combo I'm changing is solid, it doesn't behave as such on layers 1&2. And if it has extra properties such as a damage combo or warp it doesn't obey those either.

So you know how 2.55 fixed that thing in 2.50 where an Aquamentus etc. would make BOTH the enemy hurt and boss hurt sound when hurt? If you save a 2.50 quest in 2.55, it fixes that whether you want it to or not.

Luckily, this does not apply to PLAYING quests, as the old behaviour works for 2.50/3 quests in the Player, only SAVING them in ZQuest.

=== @ Jared 02/20/2022 03:08

Right in the title. I know there's a script to have each string be different, but it'd be nice if it was built in! Doesn't seem too complicated.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 03:20

I mean
it would require adding multiple pickup strings to EVERY ITEM
so, kinda wasting space for bloat

=== @ P-Tux7 02/20/2022 03:41

Can SCCs check how many POHs you have and branch to a suitable string accordingly?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/20/2022 03:42

With the new character limits, I'd imagine that "If POH = 0 go to string A, else if POH = 3 go to string B, else if POH = 2 go to string C, else if POH = 1 go to string D" would be very feasible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 03:42

. . . . no, thanks for adding another idea to my plate XD

=== @ P-Tux7 02/20/2022 03:42

Sorry, but luckily that should make this possible without any bloat

=== @ Jared 02/20/2022 04:31

I figured it’d be easier lol. Why not just add it to heart piece items?
I mean I’m 100% okay with using the script in the database, even though it does a weird thing with the sfx

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 04:39

(replying to @ Jared "I figured it’d be easier lol.…"): that's.... not a thing that CAN be done
unless it used one of the *attributes*
which, eh
I guess that could work
but blehg
having something not use it's pickup string in one specific edge case seems kinda janky

Adding extra formatting options for zscript to read values as binary
Basically, adding
```0b```
to go with the hexadecimal formatting of
```0x```
Similar for Octs could also be good?
so
```0b100```
would compile as binary 4, or whatnot.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2022 13:52

interestingly, `0b` is what C++ uses
not sure why ZC didn't follow that
should be doable, but, probably gonna wait until I'm done with all the current string editor shite

## List search by ID (#1230)

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:04

Currently the search feature in lists works by string comparison. This is handy provided one knows the names of things in the list and the list is actually sorted alphabetically. At some point the combo flag list changed from numerical listing to alphabetical. Handy for new users maybe, but I know a lot of these flags by their numbers first. And there's a somewhat different issue with the item, enemy, and sprite lists where sometimes I'll forget what I named something, but know the ID

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:05

So what would be real nice would be if a search starting with 0-9 assumed I'm searching by ID and everytging else used string comparison

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2022 22:06

Hmm
That should be easy enough

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:07

Excellent. :D

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2022 22:08

Everything from me is paused until the new string GUI is done, so might be a week or so until I get around to it

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:08

Of course, take your time
Thanks for all the work you've been putting into new features, optimizations,  and QoL stuff

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:11

Also wonder if the inverse of this request might also be possible. If the leading character in the search is a letter, ignore leading IDs. Would allow searching some lists like palettes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2022 22:12

Harder
And only works if the list is alphabetized
If it's in numerical order then you'd need to type a lot before it gets you close to the right match
That's why flags were changed

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:12

Dang. Well at least that one comes up a lot less

=== @ P-Tux7 02/22/2022 01:42

Whoa... the combo flag list is alphabetized? I didn't recall so last I checked a month or two ago

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/22/2022 01:42

Is it not?
If so it should be

=== @ Moosh 02/22/2022 01:47

Oh it might still be ordered by ID
yeah it is
But it no longer lists the number first, so I can't just type 16 and immediately hop to secret flags or 98 an immediately hop to script ones

=== @ Moosh 02/22/2022 01:49

And that was really the final straw because `General Purpose 1 (Scripts)` is kinda an awkward name to adapt to

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/22/2022 01:50

Oh god 🤢
Something else to add to the pile

=== @ Moosh 02/22/2022 01:50

...or maybe it was always called that
I've always just called it Script 1

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/22/2022 01:51

The constant in std
Is `CT_SCRIPT1`
But that's always been the editor name

=== @ Moosh 02/22/2022 01:52

Yeah for once the constant is the simpler name.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 11:57

The ID search thing is still not done, but, flags now should be alphabetized

Last time I messed with this garbage I made a rather unreasonable request but looking at it again I notice something simple I don't think I pointed out before. Every time you use the organize menu, it defaults the source and dest to 0 and 0. For dest there's not much can be done, the editor isn't a mind reader. But for the source in nearly every instance you'd want to use this menu, it's just the currently selected alias. Like I dunno why source is even a field, it makes you do this one alias at a time and type in the ID every time. 🤦

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 02/23/2022 14:02

It's true.  This would be Christmas in a can right here. 

Heck, even a button that would fill the Destination field with the next Alias would be fun,  or a button to fill the one four slots down for a vertical destination.

For instance, if non-solid combo underneath enemy changes into a solid combo, the enemy is insta-killed, like switch blocks in Mario Maker 2 and dwarven bridge in Dwarf Fortress. And specific enemies that can move through solid combos are immune to it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2022 01:03

This would take quite a bit of coding, and would likely be related to solid ffc stuff (i.e. crushing/pushing for moving ffcs)
So, good idea, but don't expect soon

=== @ TwilightKnight 02/25/2022 22:21

You might be able to accomplish this with a script and inherit combo flags

        {
            if(Screen->isSolid(this->X+8,this->Y+8))
                this->HP = 0;
            Waitframe();
        }

You'd just do that a an npc script

noticed both of these last night - same build as the music bug (2.55 a103)
first one is the link holding item sprite.
second is that link can't walk out of the room after entering it. i've tried to replicate these in a normal instance of ZC, but they only seem to happen in test mode.

unlike the previous link holding an item bug, the sprites are unchanged in ZQ:

Test mode only skips the damn file select

A simple item class that's meant for bush and grass dropsets a la LTTP so that you can randomly have enemies drop from these combos.

This class instantly spawns an NPC and kills itself off; it cannot be physically collected via touch or weapon, and giving it to the player via SCC or script does nothing without scripts except for SCCs that check to see if you own it, as with all items.

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:41

Is it just a visual issue, perhaps?
If you try to clear it, then hit OK and re-open the dialog, is it cleared?
or, even maybe just change tabs back and forth?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:43

If not, you can manually clear them in zc.cfg (while zc isn't running)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:44

I downloaded that nightly again through discord
and, have no issues whatsoever
so shouldn't even be a build error thing
Maybe reboot your pc?
(or reboot zc if you didn't already try that, though, that seems a bit obvious)

=== @ Orithan 02/25/2022 03:54

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "If you try to clear it, then…"): Once, after assigning buttons
Idk the exact proceedure

Can we please get a preview box for `Sprite Data`? Living without this is annoying lol. Gotta go back into ZC every time to test if it works correctly

I second this suggestion. It is much needed.

I'd also like this feature.
A workaround I use is making a combo to test the animation, but it's a hassle

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 22:20

Huh, so it does
You can press space at any time to swap between the two modes
so if it does that, you should hit space and try again cause you're in the wrong mode
a bit confusing and should probably have an indicator that you're in a different mode

What it was doing
well, I had something inside a loop
that was supposed to be AFTER the loop
so when it read `\16`
It was accidentally parsing that as `\1\16`
thus `\16\64` became `\1\16\6\64`
which is `change color to cset 16, color 6` followed by `insert capital A`
cset 16 wrapped to 0, it seems, as that yellow is cs0 color 6

Is it possible to get a button that solidifies an entire combo, and when you press it again it unsolidifies the whole thing?

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 02/26/2022 00:43

I wonder if it would be as simple as shift-clicking  the solidity / effect square it to either fill or empty the entire square.

😮

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 01:07

So, `Shift+Click` on a corner will set the entire square to the OPPOSITE of the corner you clicked
(so, it toggles it, then sets everything to the new value)
but `Ctrl+Click` will just toggle all 4 corners (inverting)

k, I see what's wrong
calling the screen update function only actually updates the screen 60 times a second, no matter how often it's called
but, that's not a LOOP
it calls it once, then hangs until you press a key
so if that call doesn't hit the 60/th of a second, it doesn't draw the prompt to press any key to the screen
need to add a way to FORCE update regardless of the vsync

apologies
it works as though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 10:24

Then 1 for the second choice
Or 1 first 2 second, it doesn't actually matter

(Realistically, you could use 42 first and 69 second, it's entirely arbitrary)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 10:27

So, if you wanted up/down to swap between the 2 choices, and left/ right to do nothing
You'd use `\129\0\1\1\0\0` and `\129\1\0\0\1\1`
Placed where,  *in the string*, you want them to appear
Be sure to do the `\128` code with whatever args you want *before* the `\129`s
And, it should show the menu cursor in the preview window

here's a simple example
the menu cursor here is tile `52000` in cset `0`
if you select `yes`, it goes to string `3`, selecting `no` goes to string `4`
so
`\128\52000\0\6\6\0` = `Set the menu cursor to tile 52000, cset 0, 6x6 pixels, not flipped`
`\25` = `line break`
`\129\0\1\1\0\0` = `This is cursor position 0. Pressing Up or Down goes to position 1. Pressing Left or Right goes to... position 0, which is this position, so they do nothing.`
`\129\1\0\0\1\1` = ...same as above, but flip the 0s and 1s
`\130` = `make the player choose`
`\131\0\3` = `if position 0 was chose, goto string 3`
`\131\1\4` = `if position 1 was chose, goto string 4`

Might be as crazy and ambitious as Generic, but a general pushblock type that puts all block properties in one place. Such as flags for: wait, heavy (attribute - level), once, 4-way or specific direction (attribute - directions); if it can be pushed into liquid/pits (falling sprite), over liquid/pits (draws undercombo over liquid/pits), or no pushing (this could also be conditions for an "ice block" flag (attribute - accel/step)); use screen undercombo or specific (attribute) undercombo flag, and a block trigger/hole on all layers or same layer flag
Ooooh, if it can hurt enemies too!

If shutter is a state, then a block->state attribute (would be neat for multiple blocks on the same screen open a specific shutter)

Add tall grass and shallow water sprites to either Misc. Sprites or their respective combos

=== @ vlamart 02/27/2022 22:59

Better idea: move these to a Misc. tab in Player Sprites, a long with the death blink, and if not too much, flash cset options such as what/how many csets to cycle through, or null them out if you set a flash flag to blink

=== @ 4matsy 02/27/2022 23:03

...I thought tall grass and shallow water were *already in* Misc. Sprites. When were they removed? o_O

=== @ 4matsy 02/27/2022 23:04

(Said graphics for said sprites are still in the default tileset on page 101, btw.)

=== @ P-Tux7 02/28/2022 01:47

Yeah they should be labelled MISC: blablabla

=== @ vlamart 02/28/2022 03:09

It's not in Quest->Graphics->Sprites->Misc Sprites to assign it, but at least you can edit Sprite 55 and 56

renamed for better explanation, especially now that the original misconception of thinking they had no misc. sprites at all is resolved

If per combo, would be neat to also have a "match cset" flag to force the sprite cset to match the combo placed's cset

## Player SFX for spin attack, hurt, drowning and falling (#1254)

Right in the title. Similar to the hurt SFX script in the database, but also for other player actions. I can see many others using this feature if it's made!

#deleted-channel
wait, is the spin attack sound not in the item itself?
that would be more logical
a la the swords
i might as well request item flags for them then, they don't have much else to use them for

=== @ P-Tux7 03/02/2022 00:18

also hrm i think drowning sound should be a liquid attribute (i.e. water vs. lava). i'll check to see if we have any to spare

=== @ Jared 03/02/2022 00:22

I agree!!

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) have you seen this yet?

ability to customize player sounds?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 00:55

it would be a single sound for each action
so @ Jared if you were thinking of the like, varied hurt sounds thing, then no
...but adding a single sound for the actions would allow scripts to do that type of thing
My question is, what does the SFX field on the spin scroll do, if anything?

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 00:56

You know, I haven't actually tried

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 00:56

because, that's where I'd expect to set a sound for the spin attack
with a potential separate one for a hurricane spin

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 00:57

It has a spin sound sfx

yes, though we intended to add a separate one for enemies
I think

A flag on these items where, instead of using the current sword sound (or a volley of current sword sounds) when a spin attack or hurricane spin is executed, they use the sound set in the scroll item's itemdata. This does NOT make the hurricane spin play the sound repeatedly, to allow for better customization and coordination to the hurricane spin's user-set length, so users would have to loop it themselves if they desired that.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 03/05/2022 19:55

EDIT:  Thread name changed in accordance to later discussion tidbits.

This is a completely stupid idea and I have no idea how well it would work within ZQuest.

The concept is, there's a combo type, just like any other, that wouldn't do anything _on its own._  The only thing you can do with it is list as its Attribute 1 and Attribute 2 a beginning and end range of combos, respectively.  That's literally all that you'd do with it.

What that would do is immediately replace the combo you just placed on the map with one of the combos from within the range of that combo's attributes.

This would be used to put down random combos that are just floor decorations.  If you have ten different piles of bones or forest floor leaf arrangements, and don't want to be bothered to have to place them one at a time in random locations, all you'd have to do is define your range as the ten combos of bones or leaves, and just put down that random combo that you made that represents that range of bones over and over and over again all over the screen where you want random leaves or bones.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 19:59

....then they would change every time you re-enter the screen
that'd look really weird

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 03/05/2022 20:01

Well, it would be a ZQuest-internal thing that the combo you put down wouldn't remain there.  It would immediately be replaced by one of the combos in the range that was defined.  You'd never actually see the "Random" combo in-game, or even on the map in ZQuest.

But I don't know if that's even remotely possible in ZQuest, to replace a combo with another.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:01

that isn't how combo types work
if it were a combo type, it gets handled in ZC

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 03/05/2022 20:01

I figured.  Thanks anyway!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:01

to add some sort of ZQuest *tool* might be possible
but definitely not a combo type
because like, a script can change a combo's type
so scripts could place them mid-gameplay
and that... obviously wouldn't do what you want

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 03/05/2022 20:02

Mm, as long as people are interested in such a tool.   It needn't be a script for anything mid-game.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:11

something like an alias
basically

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:11

yeah i think a right click to enable random combo mode and also in the right click menu you can enter what range of random combos (contiguous in the combo table) you want would be neato
like if you wanted one of 10 combos
you'd click the first combo
set random combo range to 10
enable random combo mode
and start drawing (using the first combo to draw being the key thing here so zquest knows where you want it to select from)

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 03/05/2022 20:12

I can see that being functional in terms of GUI access, yes.

i think it should be baked into the quest file instead of using an algorithm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:34

It shouldn't be a combo type

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:34

^

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:34

Which means it can't be a combo type
But aliases are perfect

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Or be algorithmically hardcod…"): having a noise seed in the combo type would fix it, but that's still overly complicated and doesn't need to be like that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 22:20

it shouldn't need to be in zc at all
it should be entirely handled in zq

okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 22:24

frankly having it be part of aliases makes a lot of sense
as that allows larger than 1x1 effects of this
and, it would choose which random combo to place when you place the alias
so if you want to change it you can just place it multiple times to cycle through

This would make one new item type, which uses a trigger to trade that one item type over and over, while changing its image up a tile and item Level also each time it's traded.  The item level is to mark if an NPC can accept the item or not depending on what level the item has become.  You would also need to line up item tiles to the right of the first item, depending how many tiles the trading sequences changes to, the trading sequence can be as long as programed until max level also.  NPC sprite tiles would need a command to check for trading item level. It plays another string if it detects the trading item level at an NPC. The NPC then gives you the next upgraded item level item.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/07/2022 04:34

You can already do this with SCCs

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 03/07/2022 04:34

Huh?
How?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/07/2022 04:35

Have the string goto another string if you have an item

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 03/07/2022 04:35

But how would it trade the item? 0_0

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/07/2022 04:35

have that new string give you a new item and take away the old

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 03/07/2022 04:38

the thing is

i want to use a single item for this sequence and just
switch the item image alone, and its level changes also.
kinda like how the jars you use to catch fairies in change item image

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 03/07/2022 04:40

.
I dont want to use 12 different item slots for a trading sequence is why.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/07/2022 05:07

then use a script
that's not something an item will ever be able to do in engine
it would require too many attributes to be done in one item slot

## ❓🔓[CRASH] New compiler hanging ZQ after failed compile attempt. (#1262)

The new compiler hangs ZQ if you attempt to compile again after a failed compile attempt, if you attempt to recompile if the compiler is still up.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/07/2022 20:35

....whaaat
I definitely have done this without issue

=== @ Orithan 03/07/2022 22:36

It somehow skipped the phase where the compile error window came up in ZQ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/07/2022 22:37

...that uh, shouldn't be possible
can you recreate this or did it just happen the once?
because, if just the once, there isn't much that can be done to debug it
```cpp

bool cancel = code;
if(code)
    InfoDialog("ZScript Parser", buf).show();
else AlertDialog("ZScript Parser", buf,
        [&](bool ret)
        {
            cancel = !ret;
        }, "Continue", "Cancel").show();
```
`if() do_popup_1()`
`else do_popup_2()`
one of the two should pop up
and if there's an error, it should be the `if`

=== @ Orithan 03/07/2022 23:08

Happened once

(meta) thread name was changed: ❓🔓[CRASH] New compiler hanging ZQ after failed compile attempt.

=== @ Orithan 03/25/2022 00:59

And again it happened
This was in Alpha 104
There might be something short-circuiting the code that is normally supposed to handle this.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2022 01:56

if there's any way to figure out how to reproduce it I can work at it
but if it's just occurring randomly, it could be something like rainbow death crash that isn't fixable

=== @ Orithan 03/30/2022 04:05

This is the first time I'm having a problem like this expanding a gui with your system

In debug, it gives only this as an error:

no further information while attached to debugger
I'm probably off for the night now... hope you can spare the time to figure something out here, because I'm baffled.
My only guess is that it is in some way related to `ScrollingPane`, since large mode doesn't use a scrolling pane for this, and the large mode version works fine...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/09/2022 23:50

....ok, I seem to have fixed it
by just
reverting the entire ScrollingPane to what it was before
and doing it over again, slowly, testing after each step
...didn't crash once this time.
so, uh, I have no clue what caused this issue, but it's probably still lurking somewhere.

=== @ Saffith 03/10/2022 05:01

Huh. That's fun.
ScrollingPane does some weird stuff, so there may well be an issue with it...
I'll need to get stuff updated and rebuilt, and then I can poke around a bit.

and, there was an issue there; it drew over the scrollbar.
but, not the source of the crash.
(I fixed the scrollbar thing, now if it has a scrollbar, it accounts for that in the `arrange()` call)

This one is a bit farfetched and complicated, but i just want to put it out there: A setting that makes items out of a specific layer. While matching that layer, the combo brush becomes an item brush, and you can place items down like you would tiles. I imagine this is scriptable somehow, but doing it via script would complicate the process of previewing it. I imagine this will get turned down quickly, but i thought it a neat idea anyway. also, with careful planning it MIGHT be able to be done with scripts too.

more than one item per screen is something I want, but something that isn't likely feasible

I was trying to item bundle a bomb bag (with all the increase settings correct, correct counter setup in the subscreen, etc.) and the bomb item itself. However, it will not let me access it in the subscreen unless I also bundle at least 1 Bomb Ammo. This is the same with Super Bombs, but does not occur with Arrows and Quivers

Bombs don't appear on the subscreen when you have 0 bomb ammo

(Given I know the arrow doesn't shoot without the bow, I was still able to at least select the arrow before)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 04:17

I don't think you are meant to select an arrow without a bow?
adding a bow I am able to select both
I have a feeling your subscreen isn't set correctly
Notably, do you understand how subscreens handle items that you don't have?
It acts as if you kept going in the direction you pressed
so, with how you have it set up, if you have only boomerang and bombs
you have no way to change your selection
as going straight up, down, left, and right will never lead to bombs from boomerang
Going left from the far-left column should go to the end of the *previous* row
and going right from the far-right column should go to the start of the *next* row
never the *same* row
Also, quickswap with L/R act as pressing left/right, so the way you have it set up, you can only quickswap within the same row

## Use ZScript to check if NPCT_WALK is halting (#1271)

=== @ Mitsukara 03/10/2022 01:38

When a Walking Enemy halts (stops between bursts of movement), I don't think it's been possible to check exactly when they were stopped via zscript.

Obviously, there'd be a lot of uses for this- a vanilla NPCT_WALK tends to fire weapons when halted, for one thing, so it'd be good to be able to check that. Also if you could check this, you could also do neat things like changing their defenses (a la Eyegore from LTTP being vulnerable only while moving), and you could check it to know when to draw something on the enemy while they're hatled, (like the turning heads on LTTP guards), or you could use it to make some sort of teleporting walking enemy that gets moved only when it halts, etc.

So if there isn't already a way to check this via zscript in 2.55, that'd be neat.

This is mostly an idea related to freeform shutters, but maybe a flag (a whole new combo seems like much) and attribytes to the Conveyer type combos that instead of just push you, it does "no action" (forced no button presses) and forces the player to walk off the combo in that type's direction (speed is player speed or maybe customisable)

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 12:26

I went and chased waterfalls instead of sticking to the lakes and rivers I'm used to.  Anyways I love the new additions! I appreciate that a spiraling conveyer won't force Link into pits. Neatly, though unsure how others will take advantage of it, but if a "stun" conveyer shoves Link into a pit, he falls (as expected) and if isn't a warp pit, will repeatedly push him in. However, you can save him by finessing the controls until he barely clings to the nearest few pixels to the edge

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2022 12:27

Oh, duh
Conveyors need to not count as "safe ground" for respawning

I tried making a waterfall too, same with swimming, where he'll just stand on the edge instead of back to swimming

It isn't the pit/water that's the problem, it's that it respawns you on a conveyor

Oh yeah, that's probs

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 12:49

I also had the idea of a shooting gallery mini game, and was hoping "force direction" had attribytes for specific direction, and was wondering if there is a way to "stun" while still being able to use weapons?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2022 12:56

To allow using weapons would require more complex stunning code
And the direction forced is the primary movement direction, where X wins ties with Y on diagonals

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 13:01

Fair enough, just spit balling ideas
Haven't tested it yet, but also are lit bombs or enemies effected by it?

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 13:16

Oooo, also, a flag for boots to cancel conveyer effects?

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 13:21

(I had the idea of using layers to make like "wind tunnels", "Iron Boots" would be neat for this, with a flag on the combo itself to check for the Boots, so that the boots don't effect all conveyers)

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 13:24

Sorry for idea dumping, just stoned and feeling inspired. If conveyers effected items and enemies too, you could use them in conjunction with switches to make a conveyer mini game! You could also do that with yourself as a puzzle in a dungeon as is now

This is a very minor change.  In the very latest build (I got it March/11/22.) if you enter the cheat menu in ZC Player, type a cheat code, and then press enter, instead of activating the cheat level, it just closes the cheat menu without activating the cheat as if the "Cancel" button was highlighted.

-> Related to the above, if a Constant Item script is terminated and the item is removed and acquired again, the Constant Item script does not run again. Also feels buggy.
-> Constant Item scripts play even if the player has acquired a higher level version of the same item running the same script. Doesn't seem buggy but it feels odd.

(replying to @ Alucard648 "The third one is fine, if acq…"): So, uhh, "Keep Lower Level Items" has been broken since the item editor was added
it *always* acted like it was on, even when it was off
Bug 1 was a Zoria bug in the implementation of them running
Bug 2 was not as stated; the issue was that gaining items via Cheats or SCCs was not initializing the passive item script
'Bug' 3 is a bit odd, so there's now a new QR for that.

uhh, `TriggerFlags[]`?
it's `TrigFlags[]`
`TriggerFlags[]` is the old bitwise deprecated way that is only size `[3]` and definitely is very out of bounds with that constant

I feel like that shouldn't crash though
Or at the very least give documentation on what it is and that its continued usage should not be supported.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/14/2022 22:58

As a lot of deprecated commands have been, the documentation on its' existence was intentionally removed
mostly because it *does not work fully*
because its' bitwise, it can only hold 18 flags per index
but, internally, there are 32 flags per index
so it can't read half of the flags
....but old scripts could rely on it, so it still compiles.
And aye, shouldn't crash... but Zoria doesn't know how to code.

Why?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/14/2022 23:09

because it was doing `>` not `>=` on an index bound check
so despite the array being size 3
`[3]` would pass the bounds check
and out-of-bounds an internal array
but `[4]` or higher would be caught by the bounds check and print an error
and `[0]`,`[1]`,`[2]` would all be in-bounds
so yeah
`[3]` would probably do weird stuff
which happens to be `[TRIGFLAG_BOMB]`
but anything higher or lower should either error message or work

(Note that the intended behavior is that running out of magic cuts you out of the spin attack when charged)
1) When poking walls with the charge, it skips the spin charge effect and allows you to skip the Magic cost. (Note: This is inconsistent)
2) The exception to this is when poking specifically left for whatever reason. Magic cost is still there, but the spin attack cancelling the charge is seemingly cancelled as well in favor of the poking ability and keeps you in the sword charge state. (Update: This works with any wall. As long as the other bug doesn't occur, this one always occurs)

=== @ Haylee 03/15/2022 07:20

Okay so it seems like you can do the wall poke cancelling spin attack animation in any direction

=== @ Haylee 03/15/2022 07:27

After more testing, it seems like both bugs are connected to the Poking animation cancelling either the mana cost or the forced spin attack itself, because it seems like it only cancels magic cost if you poke a wall on the same frame the magic cost happens.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2022 15:30

Funnily enough, right now, UNchecking `Decoration Sprite` would make it display....
Also, `Clippings` != `Decoration`
Clippings refers to using the hardcoded slash sprites like bushes/flowers normally use
decoration uses any misc sprite
...but you need to have decoration checked to check clippings
naming conventions were... uh... not followed before, so things were renamed to fix things.
because, you know, Zoria not the best at the whole dev work thing

Hmmz
Could be worth it as I want to release my demo with a104 (I'm busy testing it now)

=== @ NightmareJames 03/17/2022 00:58

Since Shields are the de facto way of making/printing characters, why don't we put player defenses right on them?  Is this possible, or are player defenses hardcoded right into the player class?  Let me know.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2022 02:03

The problem is, this means we would need to add a ton more to the itemdata struct
which bloats EVERY SINGLE ITEM
there isn't a way to add something 'just to shields'
other than the 10 misc attributes, which is nowhere near enough for defenses, and half of which are already in use for block flags
(meta) thread name was changed: ❌🔒Putting Player Defenses Options on Shield Items

=== @ P-Tux7 03/17/2022 03:18

(replying to @ NightmareJames "Since Shields are the de fact…"): making characters?
you can put an LTM on any item
they stack
you can have a Link with a separate tunic, gloves, and boots if you're willing to set up all the combinations
(heck that's how Bunny Link works)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/17/2022 03:20

you can even have separate characters each able to buy/use shields using non-shield items. Do you need me to tell you how?

=== @ NightmareJames 03/17/2022 07:02

Fair

=== @ P-Tux7 03/17/2022 07:10

Yeah you're really crippling yourself if you tie character appearance to shields
Because that means you cannot find shields, buy shields, or use Like Likes
I'll write up a quick tutorial for multi-LTM stacking tomorrow

=== @ NightmareJames 03/17/2022 07:20

I don't think many people would mind not having Shield Eater Like-Likes (one of the most hated enemies)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:20

Sorry haven't got on my computer the whole day

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:21

So here's how you do it
In this example we have three character states (Link, Zelda, James) and four shield states (Shieldless, Wooden Shield, Magic Shield, Hylian Shield)
Shieldless Link is the initial state, so we only have to make two character items (any item that you permanently own, basically) and three shield items (as you already know from ZC)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:24

For convenience, you want it so that each pose is X amount of pages away. A tile page in ZQ is 260 tiles, so entering a Link Tile Modifier of 260 makes him use tiles 1 page down after you get that item, like a shield.

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:29

So what does this mean? Because each player needs four pages for their four shield states, you have to set up the costume items and shield items in such a way:
-There is no Link item - he's default
-Zelda Costume: 1040 (260 * 4)
-James Costume: 2080 (260 * 8)
-There is no No Shield item - it's default
-Small Shield: 260 (260 * 1)
-Magic Shield: 520 (260 * 2)
-Hylian Shield: 780 (260 *3)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:33

So the pages are set up in this way, then (They can be ANYWHERE in the quest. LTMs just add on to WHATEVER current tile Link has that you set where it is in the player animation editor):
Shieldless Link (0)
Small Shield Link (260)
Magic Shield Link (520)
Hylian Shield Link (780)
Shieldless Zelda (1040)
Small Shield Zelda (1300)
Magic Shield Zelda (1560)
Hylian Shield Zelda (1820)
Shieldless James (2080)
Small Shield James (2340)
Magic Shield James (2600)
Hylian Shield James (2860)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:34

Those tiles are the amount that the LTM is set to when you have that combination of costume-items and shield items. So let's check the Zelda costume item LTM (1040), then add the Magic Shield LTM (520)... and we get 1560 as the total amount of tiles it's skipping ahead from the initial Link tile, tile 0.
(I'm speaking of "tile 0" relatively - as again, you can set it to be anywhere, and 1560 just means 1560 tiles ahead of whatever you set as Link's tiles in the Player Animation Editor. Notice how the default quest has his tiles on page 70-something and they work perfectly)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:37

Now, all you'd do to switch characters is use SCCs or scripts that remove the Zelda or James costume items. Storing their shield status would be trickier, but it can be done by setting three sets of shield variables (LinkShield, ZeldaShield, and JamesShield) all to 0 at the beginning of the quest, storing/setting their current level of Shield item to that variable when swapping, and when you swap, it loads the value of whichever other character and sets your shield level to the value of that variable.
Though if you're okay with them sharing shields, that doesn't have to happen

=== @ NightmareJames 03/18/2022 06:46

Hold up, I might make a whole new thread to discuss mechanics

=== @ NightmareJames 03/18/2022 17:21

=== @ cbailey78 03/17/2022 01:49

I don't know if this is possible or difficult for devs to turn most combo attribute type in fields into drop down menus.  It would make it alot easier for questmakers to set attributes to the values they want.  SFX data, Sprite Decoration, etc. Dropset for example where you can see the name of the value right away rather than having to close the combo editor dialog and go into the SFX or sprite data to find the number what slot you want and go back into the combo editor dialog remembering what slot number to type in the attribute field.  in a nutshell, it's like the palette dropdown in the Dmap editor where you can see the palette names in the dropdown menu.

## Conversion of Most Enemy Spawn Flags into GameData (#1284)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:58

ZC only uses the first enemy in the list (#-wise?) when checking what enemy to spawn in X Room Type. Having this as a flag for all 512 enemies is useless and takes away from more valuable flags.
Therefore, I propose this be set to miscQData a la Misc. Audio or Misc. Sprites with a dropdown like those, and whenever loading a quest in the player or editor, the first enemy to bear a specific flag is set as the requisite enemy for that Room Type, and all other enemies with that flag are discarded.
Everything squared in this image

Probably make it a dialog accessed from the Misc. Data menu or something that re-uses the same template as the Misc. SFX/Misc. Sprites dialogs.

not a bad idea

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 04:01

the only issue i can foresee is if these properties of an enemy are somehow checkable by scripts, and mitsukara et al used them as "free custom flags" for every enemy past the first (the actual used roomtype one)
god bless her she's done that that if it was allowed, i'm sure of it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2022 04:48

Of note for the record
script changes to `miscQdata` do not save between save/quit
script changes to `gamedata` *do*
as `gamedata` literally *is* the save file

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 06:28

Hmm
Does it increase the save file size even when unchanged by scripts?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 06:30

If so, I think it should be left as miscQdata so it doesn't. If a permanent change to it in the save file is needed (a difficulty mode where all Zoras change to something else et al), it can merely be one saved variable that triggers the miscQdata change upon loading the game

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2022 06:35

I mean
it would increase the size by 2 bytes per enemy type
absolutely negligible
it would take 500 enemy types to convert to take 1kb
and there's, what? Zora, Rocks, Ghini, Armos?
oh, no, the different trap types
I see
there's 13
so 26 bytes
...that's literally nothing.

Was helping Nightmare combine a global script with a file forked from 1st.qst. In the process I found an issue where none of my global arrays were initializing properly. The cause seems likely to be related to the script assignment dialog reporting that ~Init is _missing_

Normally that says ~Init but here it has the same -- as a script that was previously in the file but later removed from the buffer. Adding an init script to the quest did not fix the global array issue though, so I suspect something got broken by the slot's name changing at all. And the user isn't able to fix it in any way as the slot is reserved

I understand these aren't a big deal, but I might as well write it up.

Attributes:
-Enemy: What enemy ID to spawn
-Spawn Type (dropdown): Flicker, Puff, or Instant
-Enemy Max (If x enemies exist, do not spawn an NPC)

Flags:
-Use New Behaviour (a la the merging of the four Conveyor Belt types)
-Touched -> Next Combo (AKA BS Graves, but as a combodata flag). Goes to Next Combo even if touched when the combo cannot produce enemies as the enemy count is above its max
-Touch -> Next Does Not Apply When Grave's Enemy Limit Reached - Graves with the above checked that are touched when at their per-combo enemy limit do NOT go to the next combo if they can't spawn an enemy. They stay as they are and do nothing. If the extant enemies are killed, one may spawn an enemy from the combo THEN and only then may it go to the next combo. This means that you cannot purposefully touch BS-Esque Graves while their enemy cap is reached to "use them up" and invalidate their enemy spawning
Yes, I realize Use New Behaviour enables exactly two other flags - one quite estoteric. Though it leaves room for expansion
(FWIW, both LTTP and LA set precedent for multiple grave combos that spawn different enemies - the former with the Light World/Dark World Poes, and the latter with some graves that release Giant Ghinis. So this is actually a thing real Zeldas do.)

## Random Tile Noise (#1289)

=== @ Phosphor 03/22/2022 17:55

Basically just a quality of life tool for when you're working with more detailed tilesets. The user defines in a combo's properties that when being placed in the editor, there is a chance it will be replaced by one of 15 other defined combos. The frequency at which any detail tile appears can be manipulated by the user with a simple percentage value.

Under the hood, ZQ generates a random 11x16 matrix for every screen with values ranging from 0 to 15 across all entries.  Each value corresponds to one of the defined replacement tiles, with 0 being the parent tile and the modal value across all entries in the matrix.

What this feature can be used for is for detailing things like grass tiles. It can save time since the user doesn't have to go back and manually sprinkle in stuff like flowers or grass tufts onto every screen. The feature can be toggled on or off in the same way as relational and dungeon carver modes are.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 03/22/2022 18:45

A very similar discussion took place on March 5th regarding this.  It's a great concept, really.  I'm glad it's so popular.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/22/2022 19:05

Just some buttons that let you cycle to the previous or next FFC in the list while editing. Would speed up the process of setting up scripts a lot when you need to change multiple arguments.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 03/22/2022 19:12

Yep.  Agreed.

Heck, somehow, I think a text box to accept a number and a "go" button next to it would be LESS productive because who memorizes what data is in what FFC slot?  So those next/prev buttons would indeed be far more valuable.  Probably the most valuable thing.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/22/2022 19:17

Can I request that these buttons also be on the script tab. Because the dropdown being moved to that tab mildly inconveniences me sometimes when looking for an FFC carrying a script

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 03/25/2022 07:07

(replying to @ cbailey78 "Level Palette editor flickers…"): Been looking at this bug today. Very nice that it happens for Levels (new gui), but not Main (old gui), which gave me something to compare against while debugging. It _seems_ only the new gui system will modify the hardware screen while the a5 rendering thread is trying to read from it (crash!), and the old gui doesn't, but I wasn't able to fully figure out why.

One thing I did notice is that the new gui will send a MSG_DRAW event a lot more than the old one, which results in `draw_cset_proc` being called every frame vs just once. Perhaps the issue exists with the old gui too, but with this excessive re-rendering it's far more likely to happen in the new gui (without locks).

I added a lock for the screen around the drawing in `dialog_proc` and it fixed the crash and flickering. but it'll still flicker when the mouse is held down (lol) and it is noticeable laggier than the old gui. Still needs more work, but at least it shouldn't crash now. Hopefully we can figure out a way to avoid all those extra MSG_DRAWs?

Does what the Z1 Ring (Health Divisor Ring) does but for magic.
Flags:
-Use Fractional Divisor
-Divides Non-Item Magic Drains (i.e. Magic Drain touch effects on enemies. Draining 64 MP Effect Strength would now only drain 32 if you had a 1/2 magic ring with this checked, like a Z1 Ring with hearts.)

=== @ bigjoe 03/24/2022 05:30

what about any counter divisor rings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/24/2022 05:55

doing generic things for counter doesn't really work for items
because of the way items work
only the highest level counter ring would work
so if you gave multiple for different counters
only one would work
unless we implemented it in an entirely different way to other items

=== @ Orithan 03/24/2022 08:07

Do I sense like 30 different itemclasses for counter rings coming?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/24/2022 08:48

ehh
if you're using the Custom counters, you're likely using scripts anyways
so that leaves us with Magic, Bombs, Super Bombs, Arrows, Anywhere Keys, Level Keys, and Rupees/Health (when used to fuel an item). many of which are... incredibly niche either don't often use more than one at a time (so a divisor is useless) or are barely used as costs at all
and because magic is a much more versatile counter than the others it obviously should get first dibs

=== @ P-Tux7 03/24/2022 08:52

i can name one quest where hearts are used as ammo, one where multiple rupees fuel the goddess spells, and *none* where the "multiple key cost" feature added to lockblocks is used
compare that to magic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2022 22:14

The easiest way to do this
is to keep all of YOUR files outside the ZC folder
so like, make `ZC Stuff` as a folder
and in that folder, have `ZC` which is the ZC folder
and `Quests`, `Scripts`, etc as separate folders
outside the ZC folder
then you don't need to ever touch any of your files when updating
the only thing you would need to do is update your controls (unless you copy your old config, which is *usually* ok, though can very occasionally cause issues)
and copy your save file, if you care to keep it

Is this SUPPOSED to happen?

Which is "on-spec" here, developers?

=== @ vlamart 03/26/2022 02:50

I'm not sure if it is supposed, either way it is inconsistent between the options whether it is black or transparent. It would at least be nice to specify which ones with a "?" or something if it can't be streamlined

=== @ cbailey78 03/26/2022 04:35

What I understand from an NES standpoint, the 0x00 in the background would be black wheras 0x00 would be transparent in the sprite layer.  The minimap rectangle is in a background layer and te minimap marker would be in a sprite layer.

=== @ P-Tux7 03/26/2022 19:53

I think I've hit on how to make BS Aquamenti possible without tons of hardcoding.

Add Firing Styles: 1 Shot, 1 Shot Fast, 3 Shots Fast, 5 Shots, and 5 Shots Fast

Flag: Morphs

Attribute: Morph Into (0-511)

The Morph Into attribute is different from the Transform attribute which every enemy has. Upon dying, the Aquamentus enemy, should it have the Morph flag, will spawn a new enemy (INTENDED to be used with the Aquamentus class) at its exact coordinates, and that new enemy will start out invincibly-flashing (CSet or flicker depending on the QR). That way, three things happen:
1. It appears to be the same enemy, but you can change its graphics and...
2. Its firing style can be different (as in BS Aquamentus' 2nd (3 Shots Fast) and 3rd phases (5 Shots (Fast?)))
3. Its defenses can be different (as seen in BS Aquamentus' acquired immunity to everything but sword(?) in the second and third phases, but NOT the first)

In essence, a way of linking three Aquamentus enemies to look like they're three phases of one enemy.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/28/2022 01:48

why just aquamentus, why not just make this an enemy thing

## Ganon Enemy Type on Ganon Room seems Hardcoded (#1300)

=== @ NightmareJames 03/26/2022 21:45

Was doing my redo of 3rdEX, made two enemies, the traditional Ganon, and a copy called "True Ganon", which is powered up.  Took off the spawn Ganon rooms for default Ganon, this worked fine for Level 9.  Then did the "real" Level 9, and Ganon showed up, not True Ganon.  Mind you this was in test mode, not in a real quest

=== @ P-Tux7 03/26/2022 23:08

1. Make both rooms NOT Ganon rooms
2. Select each enemy in the room enemy list

=== @ P-Tux7 03/26/2022 23:09

If you want True Ganon to be in a Ganon room, edit the ORIGINAL Ganon, which is the one that shows up in Ganon rooms. This is what 4th Quest did. His enemy # is currently hardcoded. And make the "Z1" Ganon that precedes him in the quest the copy
I'm not sure if this will be solved in the future by selecting which enemy # spawns in Ganon rooms, or just by letting you set Ganon enemies in the enemy editor to do the Ganon room stuff. But not right now.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/26/2022 23:49

=== @ NightmareJames 03/27/2022 00:13

Nvm, I fixed it
Plus gave "fake" Ganon a different palette
I switched endgame Ganon to the hardcode as instructed and made Ganon Z1 a copy and a different number and enabled the rule
Took some work but it worked
Fake Ganon throws fireballs, Real Ganon throws bats
(which real Ganon's do a lot more)

Right now it seems restricted to Level 3 on classic quests and can only be turned off by compat rules.  What if you had the burning desire to use it on a different colored level somewhere else?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/26/2022 22:37

Replaces indexed colour #XXX (one of the CSet 6 ones) with a hardcoded colour (it's not even a Misc. Colour IIRC) if the current DMap's Level is 3 *and* the Level 3 CSet 6 Fix is off
Under NESFix
Though yeah like, I think that's a waste of a flag

=== @ P-Tux7 03/26/2022 23:16

I can see an argument for per-DMap atmospheric Link palettes but just making his skin lighter - and a hardcoded colour at that - is NOT the way to do it.

NES fixes stuff are fixing NES bugs

=== @ Phosphor 03/28/2022 00:33

The idea is that in addition to being able to use the trigger tab in the combo editor to set different item triggers, you can set whether or not triggering this combo has a chance for items to drop, similar to tall grass or bushes. Enabling item drops also allows the user to specify what item drop set the combo will reference when triggered, with tall grass (12) being the default value.

An additional idea is that the user can specify if the combo spawns sprites and their visual behaviors when triggered like cut tall grass or leaves from cut bushes, flower pedals, or entirely custom sprites that behave like cut bush leaves.

This can make it possible to have pots in boss rooms guarantee heart/ammo drops, like in the mainline Zelda games or bombable rocks that happen to also drop items, as a ZC approximation to something like the ore veins in Breath of the Wild.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/28/2022 01:46

=== @ Russ 03/29/2022 02:37

Copying a tile, moving to a different tile, and pressing M will move the tile. Pressing U will undo it. Previously, this worked fine. Now, even if you press undo, any combos that pointed to that tile keep pointing to the new, undone tile location. Horridly inconvenient, given that the only time I use the move function is when trying to highlight tiles to make into combos with M and forgetting I still have tiles on the clipboard.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2022 02:40

aye
this is how it's always worked
because undoing isn't smart
it literally just copies the old tile buffer

=== @ Russ 03/29/2022 02:40

... Are you positive?
I'm almost certain it didn't have this buggy behaviour before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2022 02:40

it always has
because
it literally just stores a copy of all the tile data
and it just restores that
it does not store any information about what you last did
so, since it has no idea that you 'moved' tiles, it can't very well undo the side-effects of that
this has been known about for quite a while
but, requires literally rewriting a new `undo` from scratch to fix

=== @ Russ 03/29/2022 02:43

This is now MOSTLY working
There is one slight edge-case that isn't going to be fixable without a hell of a lot larger of a rewrite
If you move a combo or tile, and that move *OVERWRITES* a combo/tile used by something else, then when you undo, it will revert everything that moved originally.... AND everything that you overwrite will be dragged with it.
i.e., it basically just does `move` in the reverse direction
but, with the standard undo behavior of restoring the combos/tiles that the move overwrote originally
just, anything USING those combos/tiles won't be anymore
...if you `Move` into empty/unused space, it should work *perfectly* to undo.

The only way to get around the one edge case, would be to literally make gigantic arrays of every enemy/combo/item/etc in the game that uses a tile, and store a copy of their tiles; which, uh, is a lot of extra memory to be eating, and a lot of work to maintain. Probably worth doing at some point (which is why I'm marking this sick instead of complete), but, fuck if I'm touching that any time soon

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/31/2022 21:37

Need to make it so Move is Ctrl + M
accidentally moving when you meant to make a combo is annoying

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2022 21:37

I'd change make, not move
Move/copy/paste are all basic operations, shouldn't require keys
Also, beware; some modifier keys already do stuff
I think alt and shift already do something when pasting/moving?

=== @ Russ 03/31/2022 21:38

I can't speak for everyone, but I use Make daily and have never once used Move
I'd make the less frequently used shortcut require the modifier

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2022 21:39

I have used make once and move dozens of times
So...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/31/2022 21:39

Mostly, accidentally doing a move is more annoying than accidentally doing a make, so move should require you to hold down a key (so if you forget to hold it or it doesn't register, it does a make), instead of the inverse

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2022 21:40

Eh, that's a fair point... though I can tell you right now it would annoy the crap out of me as a user
If you're going to do it, make a config to swap it

Paste and move make use of Alt and Shift already
Overlay uses Ctrl already
So beware overlapping those
(It looks like Alt hflips the paste, and Shift vflips it? )
Overlay uses all 3 actually
Alt and Shift are same as paste
And ctrl makes it not remove from the clipboard
## ✅🔒Ruleset option - All ZScript fixes (#1310)

=== @ Orithan 03/29/2022 04:11

This ruleset can used to just apply all rules relating to ZScript fixes to your quest.
There are a lot of tiny rules which relate to small ZScript fixes being added by 2.55, which can be difficult to keep track of. This aims to standardize script settings for modern quests to reduce the likelihood of running into snags caused by the odd fix or two not being set or unset correctly in scripts.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2022 04:12

`Modern` should do this

=== @ Moosh 03/29/2022 04:15

The issue there is that it sets _all_ rules, when the script and bugfix ones are continuing to expand with the editor and quests made in older builds might want to standardize them
While still keeping gameplay rules unchanged

=== @ Moosh 03/29/2022 04:21

Like say I boot up New BS 3.1, looking to make an old school quest with mostly Zelda 1 rules. But I also want to write scripts without emulating bugs that have long since been fixed. I'd be greeted with with this:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/958216922397278248/958219255462109204/unknown.png)

=== @ Moosh 03/29/2022 04:23

As someone who's stumbled into the issue before already I'll usually know which rules I have to check or uncheck to fix things that break. But new scripters will have to contend with things like...item scripts just not working at all because they're emulating 2.5 where they only ran for one frame. Ew.

=== @ Moosh 03/29/2022 04:27

So what I think would be nice would be a button above Pick Ruleset called "Standardize Bugfixes" or something of the sort, and it sets all of these save for maybe NES fixes (those are their own category because of some people's nostalgia after all) to what they should be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/01/2022 01:01

Rulesets will set *every single rule*
Rule *TEMPLATES* will specifically set/unset some rules, while leaving all other rules alone
Check multiple to apply multiple
`Bugfix` unchecks everything in the `Compat` tab
`ZScript Bugfix` sets script-related rules

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/01/2022 01:34

Fields in the player menu (and ZScript variables) to determine where item sprites are displayed when held up in the two holding styles.

The item starts at 0,0 of the player by default. So it would overlap a 16x16 Link by default. The default quest (AKA Zelda 1) will have values of 0, -16, -8, and -16 for these to keep it "normal".

-2Hand Held Item X Offset
-2Hand Held Item Y Offset
-1Hand Held Item X Offset
-1Hand Held Item Y Offset

-256 to 255 should be good enough, if not smaller.

Might need a rule allowing the four separate values if the current 1Hand x-offset is just "2Hand x-offset minus 8" or some junk like that.

=== @ Jennette ❣ 03/29/2022 08:51

nobody ever uses the number keys to switch palettes (what it currently does) as its pretty useless for most tilesets. i think itd be awesome to have a much quicker way of changing what layer you're working on in ZQ instead by making numbers 0-6 change you to the appropriate layer

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 03/29/2022 12:48

This is true.  The only time I ever use the number keys to change palettes (Which doesn't even affect what they look like in-game, because that's handled in the Dmap Editor!) is when I want to make a visual map of the screens I have that are used as layers, and the screens that are existing in-game.  

Otherwise there's not much of a point to these number keys.  They're a relic of the olden days.  Freeing them up for other things would be interesting.

So being able to switch the working layer with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 would be really handy.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 03/29/2022 12:49

Which would also beg the question what 7 through 9 would do.
... as well as holding shift and pressing a number.  THAT could probably change the palette at that point.

=== @ Alucard648 03/31/2022 11:56

Shift+number -> change palette, Shift+* -> Next palette, Shift+/ -> Previous palette.

```

```
``randgen->SRand();`` is setting the whole program's seed to the value that is input, not just setting the seed of the randgen pointer.
The trace spits out the same number based off the seed that is input into ``lightning->SRand(seed);``.

What's the output of `Trace(lightning);`?

Surely ``randgen lightning = Game->LoadRNG()`` initializes the ``randgen`` pointer

Previously, upon entering a cheat code, you could press enter twice, then escape, to resume playing. Pressing enter twice no longer exits the cheat menu, due to the new option to select a cheat level, and pressing escape seems to close the menu and default it to level 0, even if option for 4 is selected. Could we make it easier to dismiss this dialogue without using the mouse? Like, pressing enter if there's no text in the cheat field is equivalent to ok?
This, as an aside, is a common trend with the new GUI stuff. A lot of previously convenient keyboard shortcuts don't work anymore, adding more time spent mousing to click on options

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/04/2022 03:19

It was just requested to have enter do the cheat code confirmation
because otherwise pressing enter to confirm the code would close the dialog by clicking OK without confirming the code
escape clicks the `X` in the corner
which, rightfully cancels any changes made
I'm not sure what the best way to handle this is
and how to get whatever it is to *work*

A la the places you have to stand on and use medallions to open Misery Mire and Turtle Rock in LTTP. Using Din's Fire while on a combo with this flag triggers secrets the frame after the LWeapons disappear. It's a really cool cutscene that I'd appreciate being possible in ZC
## ❌🔒Only Highest Level of Sword Used Despite Weapon Being Set To Lower (#1321)

=== @ bigjoe 04/04/2022 18:43

In Mystical Harps, despite the fact that the weapon is set to something lower, Link uses the highest level weapon. (Which in this case is the Trident). No script changes were made that should have caused this.

=== @ bigjoe 04/04/2022 19:11

Mystical Harps has a script that disables Items when either Link or the Mermaid are in use. No changes to the script were made, which is why I think this is a ZC internal bug. Link just happens to be using the highest level sword regardless of which sword is in use. It has worked properly over many , many , versions. This anomaly in behavior is very recent.

Allow loading a `bitmap` pointer to the main and transparency darkroom bitmaps (using special bitmap ID like the system bitmaps do)

This would allow custom draws to the darkroom (though keep in mind they will need to be drawn every frame)

``npc->isDead()`` works fine if it is checked on a given enemy once per frame. It bugs the enemy's death animation out if it is checked multiple times a frame by different instances of a script.

=== @ Orithan 04/05/2022 00:18

If checked twice on a frame the enemy's death animation is blanked out entirely.

There were three LWeapons running scripts that check ``npc->isDead()`` on the NPC before death. There are now two and the enemy's death animation continues running ad infinitum

The `Dead()` function is a function that runs to check internally if an enemy is dead
This function *RUNS THE FUCKING DEATH ANIMATION WHEN CALLED*
It handles actually killing the enemy
the death sfx
the enemy never return flag

If you're on layer 1 and you copy the screen it should copy layer 1 rather than layer 0.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/08/2022 12:04

there does need to be a way to move a screen easily without needing to go to each layer screen individually and copy and paste it
(a better "paste all")
(cause the current one just sets the layers on the pasted screen to the old screen's layers, instead of copying to that screen's layers (like in the case of autolayered maps)

Copied Ring data over Item 18, which was a zz item in this quest. Didn't affect anything later on in the item list
Which probably means it has to do with itemclasses, as the items affected were the next ID down in the same itemclass

Okay, it does affect things of different itemclasses
Had it copy over the Peril Beam scroll instead of the Bracelet when I copied over Item 17

It also copied the Magic Wallet when I copied over Item 18

``\19\dmap\screen\register\value``: The ``value`` arg sets that corresponding register to ``value/10000``. SCCs cannot pick up floating point values, which makes you have to put in the numbers in increments of 10000 to make SCCs check it.

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 12:34

Apparently it magically fixed itself?

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 12:36

Regardless I found some spooky gremlins in SCCs
If you type in letters as part of the arg in the middle of an SCC by error, ZQ will corrupt the SCC
``\19\10\2C\0\1`` became ``\19\10\2\66\0\1\83\103`` when reloaded
This is in the current Nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 12:49

well, yeah
that's since 2.50.2
because of how sccs work
not fixable
`C` is `66`

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 12:50

So accidentally typing letters into SCCs leads to SCC corruption and it cannot be fixed?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 12:50

so `\19\10\2\66` is literally the same string as `\19\10\2C`
It's not any weird corruption
it's just doing what you type
when you enter a number after a slash
it's entering a direct ascii value
but any ascii values that are outside the range of normal text characters
are treated as sccs

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 12:51

``\23\61\0\0\1\90`` is switching to String 31

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 12:51

and after it starts an scc, it looks for that sccs parameters

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:20

????????????????????????????

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:20

The string table is cursed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:20

Clearly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:24

nice recording of ZCL

It's random values every time

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:29

And it's the same story when playing in ZC. First load its garbled, after reload its not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:29

wh-what
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
DEEDEE GET IN HERE
For the record, literally nothing I changed in this thread was in ZQuest

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:30

Like I said, this quest was made during alphas where the string table corruption issue was a thing
This might be a relic of that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:31

well, it was last saved in a current build, yes?
if so, then it should *NEVER CHANGE ON RELOAD*

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:31

In an older build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:31

ok
resave it in this build then?

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:31

The build it was last saved in was the build before the one you just sent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:31

like
was it last saved today
or in a build when the string table stuff
if it was last saved in any build today

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:32

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "was it last saved today"): Today

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:32

then yeah
that's a current build
so

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 15:32

wtf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:32

that's REALLY not good
my fixes today aren't even in ZQ, so nothing should have changed
well, except the fix for #1328
but that is entirely unrelated to strings

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:33

Saving is not fixing it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:33

yeah, if you last saved today
then that wouldn't
thus the problem
the point was, had you last saved before or after deedee supposedly fixed corruption
if before, well, resave
if after, well, PANIC BUTTON WHAT THE FUCK

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:34

It first cropped up in the build you posted here right before this one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:34

???

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:34

Its notable that it's not affecting the test quest you sent me
Its anything that has the /29

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:34


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961592870505160724/961650268741722122/unknown.png)
these are my changes to ZQuest today
so
nothing new would be occurring in zquest from my builds today
other than the item loading thing being fixed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 15:35

String stuff isn't my forte

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:35

(replying to @ Orithan "Its anything that has the /29"): What the fuck, why that specifically?

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961592870505160724/961650516264374282/unknown.png)
it's a 0 arg control code
it literally does nothing but exist as a single character

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:36

No it's not just the /29
It's specifically this string and one other
I am thinking this is a string table corruption error stemming from the builds where that was a problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:37

but that shouldn't change on reloading

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:38

Then ZQ must not be initializing the string table correctly on first load or something?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:38

and if it did, it would be an issue fixable by resaving
"first load"
there is no difference
between a first or second load
if you load once then load again
they run identically

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:39

Then why is it garbling the strings on the first time I open ZQ on it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:39

That is a GREAT fucking question

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:39

It goes away when I reload the quest with that instance

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:39

What happens if you first load a different quest, then that quest?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 15:39

if you re-save the quest (as a duplicate, just in case), and re-open that saved quest, does it still corrupt on opening

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:40

Yes.
Did that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:40

Here's the thing
if it looks right in the editor
and you click save

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:40

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "What happens if you first loa…"): The first time I load the quest on that instance it corrupts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:40

it should not be ABLE to fucking garble it again

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:40

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "it should not be ABLE to fuck…"): It does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:40

So wait
If you load the quest
then load a completely different quest
then load the quest again
it still works?
(Even if the different quest also has strings with those IDs that have content?)

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:41

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "it still works?"): It still works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:41

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "(Even if the different quest…"): ?

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:43

Loaded up an older version, still problems

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:44

Loaded up another quest, no problems on those string IDs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:44

but like
load problem quest
load other quest with those string IDs
load problem quest
Does problem quest still load correctly as it's the second load?
or does it have garbled parts of the strings from the other quest?

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:47

What happened:
Started instance on other quest, no apparent issues
Loaded problem quest, no apparent issues
Loaded other quest again, no apparent issues

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:48

...it must be something to do with initializing the string table then, yeah
but that doesn't make any fucking sense
and like
that hasn't changed in a fair while

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:48

This time:
Started instance on problem quest, problems
Loaded other quest, no apparent issue
Loaded problem quest again, no apparent issues
I'm going to go with my gut feelings and think one of the builds you just posted broke this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:50

I literally did not modify zquest
it literally cannot be
everything I modified about SCCs was 100% ZC-side

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:50

No it is not one of your builds
Which means I am going to get this file done and ship it off to Dimi to claim

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:51

I am gonna be so pissed at C++

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:54

Nope, doesn't fix

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:55

uhg
ok
then I have literally no clue

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 15:56

I swear to god if this is what kills 1 Screen Gollab...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:57

Here's the thing
which is good news
if it's loading correctly, just not on the first time
that means the correct data is indeed stored in the .qst
uncorrupted
it just isn't loading right on the first load due to a current bug
so, something is wrong which COULD cause corruption, if you saved after a first load
but if you load twice so that the values are right, then you should be fine to do whatever and re-save
just, don't save while the values are garbled

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 15:59

Question, do you have more or less than 4096 strings in the string table?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 16:01

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) definitely gonna need your help to look into this, because I have NO damned clue

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 16:02

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) I'll only look at it if you co-pilot/watch me stream and offer solutions
Last time I looked at it I had no fucking clue lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 16:03

Frankly deedee, the problem here is that I know what I'm doing
and NOTHING IS WRONG

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 16:03

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Question, do you have more or…"): Less

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 16:03

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and NOTHING IS WRONG"): having someone who DOESN'T know how it works poke at it is probably the better way to get something done
because, fresh eyes, and all that
@ Orithan we're gonna need the quest file

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 16:04

Am gonna package it soon
It will have to be over Google Docs because its over my upload filesize limit (THANKS DISCORD)

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 16:06

It's now affecting more strings

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 16:06

okay, so just to recap
when you open the quest once, it garbles up the string editor
but if you reopen it a *second* time, it's fixed?

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 16:07

On a couple of strings

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 16:07

What happens if you reopen it a third time?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 16:07

opening a different quest first then the problem quest also works
it has nothing to do with opening the quest twice, and everything to do with it being the first thing ZQ loads on launch
that's basically everything I can gather from this
but
that would imply to me
that `MsgStrings[]` is being initialized wrong
but
it
it just
it isn't
so I have no clue

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 16:13

This problem also extends to ZC as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 16:14

That actually makes sense
all the allocation code is shared
as is quest loader code

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 16:45

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) live update; it's reading the string fine in qst.cpp readstring
so it's breaking somewhere else

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 16:48

Saving it while it's garbled does save the garbled mess as well

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 16:55

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) you still there?
the copyText function in zdefs.h, line 3639 is where the data is getting jumbled
```void copyText(MsgStr const& other)
    {
        s = other.s;
        s.shrink_to_fit();
        nextstring=other.nextstring;
    }```
`other.s` is the correct string when debugging
but `s` is corrupted immediately after the assign; debugger seems to think it's even happening before the shrink_to_fit
so immediate thought is the way it's assigning is wrong

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 17:00

I don't see why it'd be wrong though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 17:06

This function is definitely where things are getting fucked up though; why it's doing it here and whether or not it's being caused by something elsewhere I don't know
It's certainly setting the size right and setting the right amount of characters

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 17:07

I think, anyways.
is it?
I think that's one character too many, fuck.
But either way, I breakpointed it and stuff; the value of s doesn't change at all after that *until* I change the string in the editor afterwards, so it's not getting corrupted any further after this function
I'm rambling, but that's cause I don't know how C++ strings work or where to begin looking for the root cause

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2022 20:00

in any case Emily, whenever you get up, I haven't touched it at all. You'd know more about C++ than me, you're more likely to think of some dumb reason why this wouldn't work than I would

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 00:14

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "so immediate thought is the w…"): What the FUCK?

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 00:51

If this is of any help, string 107 in the quest file was behaving fine until I changed some String->Next things in the editor.
After then I wrote it as [TBD], saved and quit ZQ
I returned to ZQ to find that it was bugging out and kept bugging out since

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 00:54

I highly suspect something is going wrong with the saving process that is corrupting data when I reload with ZQ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 00:55

No, or else it wouldn't ever load back correctly
If it were an issue in saving, it wouldn't be random at all, it would be broken every load

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 00:55

Explain how String 107 was behaving correctly until I did what I did?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 00:55

It could be an issue with some character specifically
Deedee found where it is breaking already

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 00:56

The other string that was bugging out was a string of ellipses.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 00:56

It just.... is breaking inside a standard C++ function, not a ZC function

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 00:56

105 just contained ellipses and an SCC.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 00:56

Which scc

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 00:57

``\3\0\1\106``
Its not in the file anymore because I removed it
107 never contained SCCs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 00:57

Huh
Odd
I have one idea to try to fix it, which I'll check when my pizza gets here

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 00:58

String 112, which isn't in this file, bugged out and it had the ``\30`` and ``\29`` sccs, notably with the ``\29`` being at the very end
String 105 bugged out and the scc was the end of the string

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 01:01

I'm going to see if I can replicate this behaviour in new strings on a test branch of this file

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 01:20


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961592870505160724/961797652817793084/2022-04-08_11-18-25.mp4)
This happens after I clear the strings while they loaded the correct stuff and saved

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 01:21

Tl;dr: It garbles the strings into random SCCs after the first time I type stuff into the string and exit back to the string editor after clearing it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 01:28

what the fuck

does this do anything?

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 01:31

Does nothing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 01:34

I'm SO fucking confused
2+2=71 would be less confusing than this

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 01:35

I'm going to see if I can pinpoint what things I type that cause this issue

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 02:24

I've been able to reliably replicate this bug in new strings

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 02:26

It appears putting certain characters or SCCs at the end of a string causes problems
Putting a ``.`` at the end of the string causes that string to bug out like this

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 02:30

Now any new string I am adding is bugging out

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 02:32

I am really scared now that the string table as a whole has become corrupted
I don't care if the strings themselves are not actually corrupted, there is some corruption going on here
And its affecting _every_ new string I make

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 02:34

but reloading twice still fixes it?

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 02:34

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 02:34

the actual .qst file is not corrupted then

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 02:34

The strings are being stored correctly, but there must be some sort of corruption going on.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 02:35

something is wrong in loading them

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 02:35

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the actual .qst file is not c…"): How come it's happening with only strings from this quest?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 02:35

I have no fucking clue
It has to be something specific to replicate

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 02:36

When was the new string editor added?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 02:36

feb 25th nightly
alpha is 104

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 02:38

So right after Alpha 103's release

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 02:39

I'm gonna do some digging to see if this is related to the String Editor corruption

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 02:40

oh of course it is
that should be obvious

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 03:12

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "something is wrong in loading…"): This has to be specifically because its running into corrupted data from the quest file

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 03:13

but then it couldn't load properly the second time
if the .qst is corrupted it is unreadable

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 03:13

Why is it quest file specific?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 03:14

it probably isn't
it probabably requires some specific weird thing in order to trigger

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 03:17

As it turns out, it _isn't_ related to string data corruption.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 03:32

Oh? Have you found something?

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 03:33

I grabbed a version of 1 Screen Gollab dating from prior to Alpha 103. Made a bunch of strings and saved it in this version
The majority of them are garbled

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 03:33

fun
good to have that confirmed at least

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 03:33

None of these have SCCs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 03:33

open the zquest I posted above
but
delete allegro.log first
load the quest once, garbled
send me allegro.log
delete allegro.log
load the quest again fixed
and send allegro.log again
it should be printing like 20 lines per message string, so it should be a fair bit of output
I just added a fuckton of traces

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961592870505160724/961833159425667112/unknown.png)
the `buffer` val has overrun from the previous string
...which, where I'm printing that, makes sense
that is corrected before the `stringval` printout
....and then the `copied string` is just fucking wrong
for a string of `"Last test"`
like
there aren't even any fucking special characters in that

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961592870505160724/961833642324279296/unknown.png)
this shows the same buffer issue, which is expected, but corrects it
and then *works* for the copy
like
what

For the record, the problem here
seems to be that doing `string var = otherstr` is just not working
which
is internal c++ code
and not anything of ours
so how the fuck is it broken

So, this used to be `s = other.s;`
which is a string assignment
which.... is basic C++, and should work without problems
thus the confusion as to why it wasn't working
Upon trying `s.assign(other.s)` it also didn't work
same with `s.assign(other.s.c_str())`, which uses a null-terminated ("C-style") string for the assignment
Doing `s.resize(0)` in an effort to clear the string first did nothing
...adding a trace revealed that it was, in fact, already cleared properly!
On a whim, I asked `What if I resize it to the size it needs to be? The assign should do that for me, but, why not try it?`
and fucking suddenly
I don't see the issue anymore

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 04:42

The issue can be traced back as far as the 4/4/2022 Nightly

(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
anyway, if you can just confirm that it isn't fixed ONLY for me or some shit
that would be wonderful
because at this level of cursed bullshit, I think we just have to excpect everything to go wrong
Also, curious if @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) or @ Saffith have any ideas about this
because like
I have no idea why assigning an std::string to another std::string would fail
but work if you add a manual resize call first

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 04:46

It's fixed on my end

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 04:46

For reference,
`s = other.s;` -> garbled garbage character values
```s.resize(other.s.size());
s.assign(other.s.c_str());```->works
where `s` and `other.s` are strings
curious if resizing before a standard `=` assignment would work
or if the `.c_str()` is necessary
but frankly don't care enough

What prevented previous builds from getting flagged?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 04:52

not a clue, nothing's changed there
perhaps something changed on BitDefender's end
or perhaps some random bit of the binary in the code changed in a way that happens to be creating a false flag

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 04:53

It's not affecting the previous nightly

I have no idea what else would cause a new flagging

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/08/2022 04:55

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) how was MsgStr made? I think using malloc to instate a std::string member is a bug b/c std::string sets up some memory in its ctor, which malloc approach skips
this seems to corroborate https://stackoverflow.com/a/33210759/2788187

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 04:55

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) how was…"): yes, but it is nulled after that

uhhh
that sounds like BitDefender itself is being a virus

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/08/2022 04:55

and I see some calls to malloc for this class so I think thats the problem. the resize is fixing it because std::string is then owning its own memory again as it expects

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 04:56

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "and I see some calls to mallo…"): `resize(0)` did not fix it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/08/2022 04:56

(just a guess)
huh idk then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 04:56

and, printing the string before resize
it was printing `\"%s\"` -> `""`
so, size 0, just an empty string
but then upon assigning to it
it suddenly was garbled as hell
I removed all `memset` calls clearing the `MsgStr` class
replacing them with a `.clear()` call, which did `s = "";`
because, I figured memset/malloc might be an issue
but once `s = "";` ran and it printed as `""`, I figure that wouldn't be the issue anymore
even if it were, I would think `resize(0)` would fix it

=== @ Orithan 04/08/2022 04:58

It's also killed my Firefox stuff

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/08/2022 04:58

but still, a class with std::string fields shouldnt be made with malloc. if you do `new` then std::string ctors gets called as expected. otherwise malloc is just zeroes and who knows what setup std::string ctor does is missing. my assumption is that some ammount of .resize or .assign triggers the same setup code its `ctor` would

```
The first type:  “Infected”

Often these ‘false positives’ directly state the file is infected, typically with something ‘generic’ in the name.  Many times this is due to the software compression applied to the executable (program) file, in order to reduce file size and perhaps to help make the software “portable” (meaning it doesn’t require ‘installation’ on a PC, but can run from wherever you downloaded it to.)

Tools used to compress executable files (aka ‘exe packers’ or similar) can greatly reduce file size, saving space but also internet bandwidth in distribution efforts, ultimately reducing overhead costs.  They can also obscure source code that is visible (using the right tools) inside the program, providing protection against decompilation and other techniques of ‘reverse-engineering’ the software, which software crackers would use in theft of the product, such as ‘piracy’ (through usage and/or distribution) but also with theft of the intellectual property itself by direct source code reproduction.

Of course, the above also makes it more difficult for an Anti-whatever vendor to make a determination about the software’s intent – more often than not they don’t care to properly unpack and examine the executable, but rather mark it as malicious simply because that type of compression is detected.
```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 05:37

Pffffft
That's fun
That's like just saying "All zip files are malicious because they are compressed"
To be fair, GDrive basically does exactly that
But it's error isn't that the zip is infected, rather it specifically says `yeah we can't scan this, so, no idea if it's good or bad`

## 💊🔓Game Time (Quest Rule) object not on passive subscreen (#1330)
@ 4matsy opened this issue on 04/07/2022

Status: needs-testing

Labels: ['bug', 'needs-testing']

Source: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/961592895482249246



=== @ 4matsy 04/07/2022 11:46

So @ NightmareJames just ran a stream earlier this morning on Prototype 6F to test out the new DoS party system on 1st Quest one more time. It was a relatively bug-free run, but I made a suggestion after the run that maybe the quest timer on the passive subscreen should be made visible at all times, so that no one needs to pull down the subscreen just to see their time, which itself wastes time. 😛

Problem is, James had difficulty getting it to work, which I found odd, as I remember experimenting around with it in the past and successfully doing it.

After some experimentation with an old quest file of mine which *did* have it visible, I found the issue: there's a bug in ZC. 😮

So, in the subscreen editor, both the "Game Time" and the "Game Time (Quest Rule)" objects have three checkboxes in the Location tab of their properties: "Active Up", "Active Down", and "Active Scrolling", which respectively control whether the timer in question is visible when the active subscreen is up, down, or in the process of scrolling. The bug is that the (Quest Rule) variant actually disregards the "Active Down" checkbox, rendering said timer invisible on passive subscreens when the active subscreen is hidden from view.

=== @ NightmareJames 04/07/2022 11:57

I'm out now, will post verification when I get home

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 13:28

(replying to @ 4matsy "So @ NightmareJames just…"): Would "Active Down" not be the active subscreen being OPEN, as in, dropped down?
sounds like "Active Up" is the one you want

=== @ 4matsy 04/07/2022 13:55

It might actually be that way around, I haven't been able to check how the code goes.

=== @ P-Tux7 04/10/2022 08:44

Stomping two enemies at once hurts the player. I presume that this is because of the stomp weapon being "used up" on one of the enemies. Perhaps a QR should be made to let the weapon unconditionally exist for a frame or two when landing instead of dying upon collision with an enemy? Granted, I'm not sure how this would interact with enemies that "block" (and presumably kill) the stomp weapon, but it's at least better.

Say we have a situation like this. There's a cliff corner piece at the edge of a screen
In 2.53 and in older alphas of 2.55, if you walked off the screen and landed on this cliff tile, you could turn back to the  right and scroll back to the previous screen
As of alpha 105, you no longer can, creating soft locks in a crapton of older quests

=== @ Russ 04/10/2022 14:29

I've brought this up in the past, but it's still an issue and I'm really getting tired of working around what is likely a one line fix. If you change the enhanced music for a dmap via script, tile warps within the dmap, or between the dmap and another that shares the same music, cause the music to reset. This does not happen for side warps. It only occurs with tile warps. Could someone _please_ take a look at what is different in the music handling code in the two warp types and fix this. It's getting rather annoying rescripting tile warps to use side warps.

## Editor setting to preserve layer data when deleting screens (#1340)

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:15

When you delete a screen in ZQuest, currently it also clears its layer data. When using autolayer, this can prove a minor inconvenience as we need to either reassign the autolayer or manually reassign layers for the deleted screens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 11:15

Hmm
Similar idea to deedee's suggestion in #1327
Which was a version of paste all that copies not the layer reference, but instead copies the layer data to the layer already set on the dest screen
So like, we have special pasting options

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:17

Interesting. That'd be welcome as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 11:17

Adding similar for clearing data shouldn't be that bad?
`Clear All`, `Clear All but Layer Data`
And anything else that would seem useful

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:19

I figured it could be a ZQuest wide setting. Because users are typically either using autolayer and want to preserve layer data when deleting, or aren't and would likely prefer the old way

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:20

But I wouldn't be opposed if it were a dropdown with an easy enough shortcut, like palette pasting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 11:24

Favorite commands are always nice
and, what I could do
is make it so that it's all in a new gui?
You could like, check which things you want deleted?
probably as an *in addition* to a menu with all the individual options
so you won't need to uncheck everything to check one thing, and then re-check the rest

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:25

Like a popup? Seems like it might add more hassle than it solves

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 11:25

(though I'd have a Un/Check All buttons)
I would think that would be useful because it could get a keybind
like, Shift+Del or something
and that's the easiest way to delete everything EXCEPT one thing
instead of needing to add that option for like, each possible thing

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:27

Yeah that makes sense

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:29

So like Shift+Del opens a special delete window, you select your options, enter confirms, and it remembers your settings from the last time the window was opened?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 11:39

yeah, that's the idea
not sure when I'll get around to this, gotta have the energy for gui work and shit
but, definitely a good idea on the table

=== @ vlamart 04/11/2022 18:24

I think shortcut and QOL options should also be in the launcher like the number pad shortcut option. So users can have their preferences before even opening the editor

=== @ NightmareJames 04/11/2022 16:37

Would Enemy Flag be better?

=== @ P-Tux7 04/11/2022 16:38

enemy flags are limited; QRs are not
also generally the questmaker would want this bug fixed for all Manhandlas so it being a per-Manhandla flag would be pointless

=== @ P-Tux7 04/11/2022 16:45

oh turns out this isn't quite a bug
"Manhandla" is the same animation style for both Old and New enemy tiles; it all depends on the QR
so unless you want to go through the undertaking of doing that for EVERY hardcoded animation (Moldorm, Aquamentus, Gleeok, Digdogger, Manhandla) I think I'll just convert 3rdEX to New Enemy Tiles
i guess you COULD call that a bug but like... blegh

Ordinarily, the Triforce displayed on Ganon's ashes uses hardcoded CSets from Zelda 1. But after finishing Tiny Quest Gold in A106, I noticed it used the CSets from the quest.
The CSet of the ashes appears to be correct, though.
This ain't right.

OK
Fixed, and did some more
There's now a compat rule for 'old selectors'
and with that unchecked, it will attempt to stretch the selector to the item size
uses the hitwidth/height/offsets for precise pixel measurements, respects size on both the selector and the selected item

Preview in the item editor now accounts for size
If you change the size, you need to click `Refresh Preview` to reload it; size information needs to be known when creating the dialog, so it needs a manual reload to resize it.

I'm sorta running into a issue where the fire gleeock's animation is borked in my untitled project. admittedly it could be something to do with quest rules but the Gleeock 1 animate just fine. I have tried completely moving Gleeock 2's tiles elsewhere and I end up having to fix it up like so.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/16/2022 11:42

@ FireSeraphim Check Data 2. Neck offset 1 is the tile offset from the main gleeok's tile (what you have selected as the gleeok's tile) that the Neck's tiles start at. Neck tiles use 4 frames of animation. Neck offset 2 is the offset from *that* that each subsequent neck tile uses (allowing you to have a unique tile per neck). For example, a Neck Offset 2 of 20 would mean each neck segment would use the tile one row down from the last.
I want to say you want a neck offset 1 of 40, and a neck offset 2 of 20 (or 0 if you are fine with the necks being all the same tile)

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/18/2022 02:18

is that segment near the body supposed to have such a high render priority? I mean I appreciate your help and it has helped to fix gleeock 2 so that it renders properly in my side project but I can't help but to pin some question marks on that neck segment near the body in both cases

if it isn't checked, then the canwalk function it uses skips the 15 pixels that aren't the leftmost or topmost side that's being checked
if offgrid is enabled... it only skips 7 pixels instead of 15
yeah I think I'm just gonna replace the canwalk function it's checking with the ghosted one.

So two things, for starters, I believe this rule is incorrectly categorized. It's listed as a bug fix when it should be a combo rule. This has way more gameplay repercussions than a simple bugfix should. Secondly, on attempting to check how it handles cycling pits, it dumped me at dmap 0, screen 0. Could be a quirk of test play mode, but I made certain to take multiple warps and step over several valid respawn points first.

Little quirk of onDeath scripts that I assume is because they run over the regular game over sequence: you can't use F4 to frame advance through them. While it's not super critical, F4 is a very helpful debugging tool when making complex animations and can catch issues that only show up for a split second. It would be nice if there were either a quest rule or even just a change to frame advance being limited during game over and credits overall. I don't think anyone's gaining an unfair advantage by TASing the death animation.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 04:11

Sooo disabling F6 and disabling F4 are tied to the same thing

Okay question now, how do I end the ondeath script?
Assumed set Link's HP and quit out to resume normal gameplay, but that just causes him to die again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 04:47

You cannot revive him
onDeath runs after he is already dead and gone
the only way to avoid 'engine death' running is to `Game->Continue()` or `Game->SaveAndQuit()`, etc

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:49

Ah, so if I want to do a quick wipe transition this isn't the way to go about that.

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:50

Is there a hack I could use to still get the handy screen freeze effect but run the script sooner? Like calling a subscreen script?

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:52

Or I suppose I could do a big wacky suspend setup the old fashioned way. I'm just spoiled by the convenience of how the subscreen script freezes everything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 04:57

You could use a subscreen script, by setting the current dmap's active subscreen script and then pressing start... but that's a little janky

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:58

Yeah if it weren't for the then pressing start thing that'd be ideal.

Why's it need a new type?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 04:59

a slot that does nothing unless you launch it from another script
and you can either set them to run passively, or to run freezing everything
but they won't have a `this->` as they won't have an object
things that freeze things now are all built into specific types that work specific ways

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:00

Gotcha sounds exciting. So it could work kinda sorta asynchronously?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:00

but without needing to be tied to an item
and, with the *option* to make it freeze everything until script is done

=== @ Moosh 04/20/2022 10:51

Pretty straightforward. If there's an enemy with SFX on the screen, it stays silent after the subscreen is closed. If a new instance is spawned afterwards, it starts up again. Similar thing happened with potions in 7th so hopefully the same fix can be applied here

=== @ Moosh 04/20/2022 11:29

Currently the script runs immediately rather than running the warning dialog. I guess the user could write their own warning dialog, but...That's dumb. I just wanted to standardize the visuals on my F6 menu to fit with my game over menu, for consistency. Seems right now this comes at the cost of user experience as feather fingering the F6 key will result in lost level progress

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 08:56

realistically, the best way to handle this is to add a `cancel` option to the menu
that exits the script without calling a continue option
Unlike the `onDeath` slot, wherein you cannot 'undo' the death
you *can* just exit the onF6 script to resume exactly where you were before pressing F6

I know you guys have expressed intent to rewrite Zoria's jank entirely but for now it's here and it's mostly working, but the constants he gave in the docs aren't actually in std. Seems like it should be trivial to add those.

It feels dirty every time I enter in a magic number while using these

I don't think the HitBy system is actually terrible an idea; so the implementation will likely remain the same
but yeah, Zoria was terrible with constants
we need to add that
(also I need to add a version for weapons so weapons can detect when they've hit something without looping through every enemy)

Would be neat. Although it's not hard to do that as is. I have a system for my quest
Checks HitBy on enemies in the existing global enemy loop and stuffs the enemy's pointer in one of the weapon's Misc indices
I guess that's technically still looping through enemies, but it was something I'd already be doing to begin with

Huh.  I remember Zoria implementing what may have been a single frame when the Hero health reached zero to run a script, but I guess that never happened?  I remember that I was the one that suggested it even for this reason, or to give the game a chance to bring him above 0 health somehow if it went below 1.
Even Alucard648's suggestion adjacent to this one ("Hero - Instant Kill") suggests that there is such a frame.

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/23/2022 11:46

This room is a fine example because there's two fireball shooters but their fireballs don't emit any light. What I would like to recommend is the addition of a "Emits Light" checkbox and a light radius box in the sprite data editor

Agreed that there should be a way to do this without scripts, _however_ if all you need is the weapons to emit light, the script to do so is so simple even you could write it:
```eweapon script EmitLight{
    void run(int radius){
        this->LightRadius = radius;
    }
}```
Since fireball shooters are just an enemy, you can give that enemy a weapon script

that's cset2
the cset the combo is placed in isn't part of combodata, it's part of the *screen*

The `CSet` was added before combodata scripts were even thought of
and again, Zoria has no sense for common sense

and does not work for any combodata that is not `this->`
or in any other script type

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "keep in mind though that `Pos…"): can you elaborate what you mean
so if I did something like, `combodata combo = Game->LoadComboData(blah blah blah);` I wouldn't be able to get the `combo->Pos` of that?
only from within the combodata script itself when using the `this->` pointer
?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:24

correct
because if I load combo 52
....that combo could be placed in 50 different positions on the same screen
so how the hell would it know what to return?
Combodata *SCRIPTS* run with a specific position, so they can return that value

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/24/2022 01:26

Okay, noted

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:26

same for `Layer`
and `X`/`Y`
```
int Layer();
int Layer;

 * Using this from any other combodata variable is illegal and undefined.

int Pos();
int Pos;
 * Returns the combo screen index of a combo from a combodata script, from the 'this->'
 * pointer as 'this->Pos()'.
 * Using this from any other combodata variable is illegal and undefined.
 * Read-only

int PosX();
int X;
 * Returns the X-coordinate of a combo from a combodata script, from the 'this->'
 * pointer as 'this->PosX()'.
 * Using this from any other combodata variable is illegal and undefined.
 * Read-only

int PosY();
int Y;
 * Returns the Y-coordinate of a combo from a combodata script, from the 'this->'
 * pointer as 'this->PosY()'.
 * Using this from any other combodata variable is illegal and undefined.

it does specify this in all of their docs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:32

fun thing is, `LoadTempScreen(0)` gives you a mapdata pointer that works just like `Screen->`
so, for any layer 0-6 that gives you a direct temp pointer

## Combo Data Oversight involving Water vs Shallow Water Combos I noticed (#1376)

So I noticed that because water combos and shallow water combos use the first attribyte slot, there's an issue where when walking over water combos, it will play the shallow water sound relative to the flipper level, since there are instances where water acts like shallow water. Earlier the water combo I had before required flipper level 2 and as a result, it was playing the second sfx instead of no sfx.

It would be nice if there was a keyboard key which could advance your currently selected combo +/- 1 combo in the combo page, since sometimes related combos are laid out in series and it would be a lot easier to just press a key to advance to them than go back and forth between the combos with the mouse. I suggest the `[` and `]` keys for this, since I think those aren't already occupied by a shortcut, but I'm not very picky about which keys could be used for this.

## Modify Invulnerability Flicker Rate (#1378)

=== @ Orithan 04/25/2022 06:01

Can we set the flicker rate of sprites when invulnerable with the quest rules that cause invincible sprites to flicker? This is to make it so quest makers who use the rule don't have to deal with framerate issues causing problems with visibility?

=== @ Moosh 04/25/2022 06:03

This could also influence CSet flash rate while invunerable too

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/25/2022 10:47

might be worth making it a player option too?
for the same reason, in case someone recording zc needs to tweak the flicker rate so it shows up nicely

=== @ Russ 04/25/2022 14:09

It being a player option could be handy. Unfortunately, that wouldn't fix the many issues of scripts making stuff flicker at 30 FPS but it'd go a long way to making the problem better.

## ✅🔒Useable pickup items (#1381)

Status: fixed

Labels: ['feature']

Source: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/968315085510545438



=== @ Mitsukara 04/26/2022 00:58

Silly feature request, but, it'd be neat if, in zquest, if you set an item that's usually only a pickup item to be an equipment item, then when the player uses it as a button item, it activates the effect it would normally have when you pick it up.

For example, if you go in the item editor and make a Clock an Equipment Item, and put it on the subscreen, then when the player uses that Clock item, it acts exactly as if they'd picked up the Clock.

The two Items this could make the most sense for are:
- Clock
- Kill All Enemies

But it might be neat for other pickup items such as hearts, magic, or maybe some kind of generic "increase counter when used" type effect.

I realize this is all dead easy to do with zscript, but it might be a neat ease-of-access thing for non-scripters to be able to do this, like having a clock item that costs magic (or is removed after use like a potion, since the item editor already has that option too), etc.
Also, I realize this is a bit of a different idea maybe, but, requiring/spending from an arbitrary counter instead of just from magic/rupees would be nice, if that's not already a feature.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/26/2022 00:59

that already is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/26/2022 01:05

The refiller class can refill up to 5 different counters, and optionally cure sword jinxes, when used
If it cannot do anything (i.e. every counter it fills is full and no sword jinx to cure) it will NOT charge its' cost, and will play the 'error' sound to indicate being unable to use it

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:45

(replying to @ vlamart "This could also make shields…"): sidenote about my own opinions on the active shield thing: it'd be neat, but it also raise the implication of like, the other behaviors Zelda shields typically have such as prevent contact damage from enemies /pushing certain enemies away (or being able to slowly push urchins like pushblocks, etc) which is probably beyond the scope of new items I think Emily would want to add to pre-rewrite ZC?
although a compromise in between somewhere could still be a neat thing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:45

I added active shields
But it just toggles the shield

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:46

oh, neat
it's something at least

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:46

It does also toggle the LTM
Which is all it does for visual
It also has a sound for when you press the button to pull it out

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:47

hmm... if it only has one LTM, I guess that means the shield just kinda disappears when not in use, rather than being carried around on Link's side like the gameboy games

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:47

Yeah

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:47

I always liked the idea of like, scripting a shield that would actually work on Link's side, like when you're charging the sword in LTTP, but that gets a bit complex
or more generally of being able to put the shield on any of Link's sides
like wearing a shield on his back for instance, and it blocks projectiles from the back

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:48

So, a second ltm, and an altered step speed while holding it, are both good ideas on the table
Shield sidedness sounds like a nightmare

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:48

Yeah, probably a bit much to ask

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:49

Pushing 'urchins'.... would require enemy solidity.
Which, IS still on the todo

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:49

I'm surprised Darknuts even have it, though it's cool they do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:49

The problem is,  making the shield affect multiple sides is easy
Making it affect front in use, side otherwise is a bit odd

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:50

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "The problem is,  making the s…"): huh. Silly suggestion, but, would it be hard to add an option for a multi-sided shield as a form of shield upgrade, then?
I'm not sure how much sense that would make though
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Making it affect front in use…"): not sure I parse this, either, sorry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:51

I mean, if you sprited it as Link glowing with an energy shield or something...
(replying to @ Mitsukara "I always liked the idea of li…"): ^

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:52

oh you mean like, front when used, side when not used. That's not really how it works outside of LTTP though (and then it's only "not in use" when charging the sword)
I was thinking more like.... let's say Link has an item that's a "back shield", it works just like a regular shield, but only on the back. Like as a seperate shield item altogether

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:53

Yeah, exactly why it'd be "a bit odd" to try to get anything working
And ehh
Separate item for the back... would need to be an entire dupe itemclass

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:54

basically I'm thinking of the thing where Darknuts have the "Shielded in front" "shielded on left" etc options

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:55

As flags on an existing shield, it might work
But a separate item specifically for the back is not sane

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:55

So for instance you could make like, a regular shield itemclass item (if that'd be easier), but check a box for saying which sides it covers (multiple sides would be neat though)
so it's like, you upgrade from a level 1 shield item that's just a front shield, to a level 2 shield item that's a front and back shield

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:56

That could be doable

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:56

and that would also allow someone to use zscript to toggle it to different sides if they wanted to, without having to like, recreate the entire shield behavior in zscript
so if they wanted the thing where the shield is only covering one side, but it can be moved from  just Link's front to just Link's right side during charging or something, they could script that by toggling between which shield item Link has. (...except I think maybe charging disables shield blocking altogether, which is a seperate problem)

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:59

plus it could just be a fun silly thing to have like, a quest where shields are only on Link's back. So you gotta learn to look away from projectiles
or maybe let's say a quest has multiple characters, they could each wear the shield differently (by using a different shield item)

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:02

sorry this mutated into an entirely different, more complex feature request. I could make a new thread if you'd like? I wasn't even sure how viable this idea was so I didn't think to ask for it more directly

It's fine

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:03

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:09

I had these silly Darknut enemies that just... plopped shields onto extra sides. So Link could do that too, just inexplicably wearing extra shields affixed to his sides XD

Npc scripts are a thing though
And can do a lot, without needing any header

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:13

I never actually learned ghost, although most of my extensive work was in 2.50.2 which didn't have the NPC script slots yet. I had my own janky system where I had the global script (and sometimes, manually placed FFCs) controlling enemies
I would've totally been using NPC script slots if they were a thing yet though
I liked to do a lot of like, simple tricks for existing enemies. Like making a regular aquamentus move up and down, or making a walking enemy jump at random times
it was often a little janky but it got some neat effects

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:16

when learning, it's also good to draw inspiration from really simplistic stuff, like some of the Zelda II enemies or Super Mario Land or games like that, where enemies have extremely simple behaviors- like there's these birds in ZII, Mobys, that just appear at the top of the screen at random horizontal positions, move down until they're aligned with Link, and then move switch to moving left (or right, depending on whether Link is to their left or their right)
dead simple to script those little guys, so it's a good one to learn with

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:17

They also don't have many animation frames XD

A flag that makes it so that it adds the power value to the damage instead of a multipler/another attribute where you can add damage to the spin attack along with the damage multiplier similar to how the attack ring works.

Was looking for a way to prevent enemies from flashing CSets in NPC script. Unless I'm overlooking something there isn't one without turning off the enemy's iframes. Apparently Link has a bool InvFlicker that turns off just the animation. Maybe enemies could have the same?

I would like to request a roomtype that basically a more modifiable version of the "Leave Money or Life" roomtype (infact it might need to be split into two roomtypes for a variant that only cost money) that allows for the shop type item list to be used to determine what Link will have to give up to unblock the way forward.

If you call ``DrawTile()``, either the Screen or Bitmap variants, and set both the scale (``xscale`` or ``yscale`` not being ``-1``) and the rotation (``rangle != 0``) args, you get real funky results.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/28/2022 10:56

```cpp
if(canscale) //scale first
{
    //damnit all, .. fixme.
    BITMAP* tempbit = create_bitmap_ex(8, xscale>512?512:xscale, yscale>512?512:yscale);
    clear_bitmap(tempbit);
    
    stretch_sprite(tempbit, pbitty, 0, 0, xscale, yscale);
    
    if(opacity < 128)
    {
        clear_bitmap(prim_bmp);
        rotate_sprite(prim_bmp, tempbit, 0, 0, degrees_to_fixed(rotation));
        draw_trans_sprite(bmp, prim_bmp, x1+xoffset, y1+yoffset);
    }
    else
    {
        rotate_sprite(bmp, tempbit, x1+xoffset, y1+yoffset, degrees_to_fixed(rotation));
    }
    
    destroy_bitmap(tempbit);
}
else //no scale
{
    if(opacity < 128)
    {
        clear_bitmap(prim_bmp);
        rotate_sprite(prim_bmp, pbitty, 0, 0, degrees_to_fixed(rotation));

    else
    {
        rotate_sprite(bmp, pbitty, x1+xoffset, y1+yoffset, degrees_to_fixed(rotation));

The `if` block here fails, while the `else` (no scale) succeeds

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 04:52

@ Orithan does it do this with `rx <= -777` and `ry <= -777`?

It functions properly with ``rx <= -777`` and ``ry <= -777``

I was thinking with the current shield, maybe a flag to make it active, then attributes and such for changing step speed (where 0 is standing still) and one for an extra PTM for the holding shield sprites (that way, to stack with the item's inherent PTM)

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "specifically regarding player…"): I don't think it does that yet

Of note: I also cleaned up some things that weren't quite polished with it
notably, I had set it so you can't attack while using the shield... but not that you can't use the shield while attacking?
so, uh, now it cares about `Action` for whether or not you can shield
`none`, `walking`, and `rafting` are valid
if rafting, it ignores the `Lock direction` flag, as that would prevent the raft from turning and get you stuck on every corner.
and raft speed is not affected either

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒Active Shield

=== @ vlamart 05/07/2022 14:33

Can't tell if bug, but if you keep multiple level active shields, the lower level shield (or maybe the shield with the lowest block value because I also tried this with two level 1 shields) doesn't work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 14:36

hmm
So, this doesn't really work like other active items do
shields are generally passive items, so a lot of their checks use the passive item check code
which uses the highest level shield
Gonna have to say 'not a bug, just a limitation'

=== @ vlamart 05/07/2022 14:56

That makes sense, because a similar thing happens with scripts. I used UsingItem() to draw something over Link when using the shield, the script works on the lower level shield, even though the shield item itself doesn't activate. And the script doesn't work on the higher level shield, even though the item does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 15:03

aye, because the `UsingItem()` is getting the ID on the button, while the engine is getting the highest level shield
definitely feels like something I need to patch, but it will take a bit of rewriting to fix that

at least last i checked

If you use the 'inactive' feature of it, it will only use the highest level for that
but using the active, whatever one you are holding down is the one that it uses

## Stomp Boots Features (#1391)

=== @ Mitsukara 04/30/2022 20:46

Some  suggestion for Stomp Boots items, basically to make it work more like the Downward Thrust attack (and Upward Thrust?) in Zelda II:

------ Multiple enemies fix:

0. Make the boots able to land on 2+ enemies at once without the player getting hurt. (QR or flag?)

------ Bounce:

1. "Bounce on enemies' heads" flag. When you land on an enemy, in addition to damaging them, Link gets a very small amount of jump (should prevent Link from getting hit, too). Maybe about jump = 1?

- 1b. As above, but also add a "bounce on enemies that block stomp boots" flag; bounce off an enemy which blocks stomp boots, without taking damage.

- 1c. As above, but "bounce on enemies that ignore stomp boots".

------ Mario-esque high bounce:

2. "Higher bounce when holding jump"; if you're holding the button for a roc item as you land on the enemy, you bounce higher. Maybe jump = 2? A settable number might be good if that's not a massive pain, but it sounds like a massive pain because GUI implementation.

------ Sword:

3. "Draw current sword when falling" flag. Link's current level of sword weapon is drawn, facing down, in front of Link as he falls (for up and down, it should overlap the Link sprite / the Link sprite should overlap it). No extra animation for Link is needed here unless you really want to get super fancy with it.

- 3b. "Require sword to use". If Link has no swords, these stomp boots won't work. 

- 3c. "Use sword defense type". The stomp boots check an enemy's sword vulnerability instead of stomp type.

------ Upward version:

4. "Stomp boots hit enemies above Link" flag. Enemies above Link's Z (and possibly like, Peahats?) take damage from these stomp boots. This would happen while jumping, instead of while falling. 

- 4b. "Stomp boots don't hit enemies below Link" flag. (If this flag is off, and the one from Suggestion 4 is on, then Link hits above while jumping, and below while falling)

- 4c. "Draw current sword when jumping" flag. This sword draw points up.

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2022 20:53

That first one sounds like a no brainer suggestion. Instantly gives the item better feedback overall

(..."stop boots" lol)

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2022 20:54

I'm also not sure, does the item still have the janky property where you can stomp one enemy and get hit by another the same frame because it only puts the first into iframes? I recall that being a thing in older versions

=== @ Mitsukara 04/30/2022 20:55

Good question

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2022 20:55

It was very easy to just trade hits when using the item in ways that felt "correct"

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2022 20:57

The bounce property on enemies that block the boots would also really improve on this

=== @ Mitsukara 04/30/2022 20:59

Overall, the vanilla stomp boots are very much a "ooh, this sounds cool!" and then you try it and it's disappointing, kind of item. The ones in Legacy of the Wizard at least reliably hit the enemies and not the player, generally

=== @ Moosh 05/01/2022 04:10

So if hithero returns a value based on the type of hit it can use that to cancel out of the return? Or could that have catastrophic results due to some c++ thing I'm not aware of?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 04:12

well I'd need to change hithero from a void to an int
also the return is there to prevent it going to weapon code
if the return isn't hit, it still wouldn't check another enemy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 04:14

So it'd need to loop through more than the first enemy, which means changing GuyHit to not just return the first enemy, but return the first enemy from a starting point

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 04:37

So probably poor form but I'm unsure if I want to make fixing this qr-based or not

Dumb idea I have for a script addition. (I dunno if it already exists)
But something like
Hero->ImmutableX
Hero->ImmutableY
returns link/hero's X/Y pixel position based on the entire map, rather than a given screens.
I know this is technically already achievable with basic math, but being able to *set* these values too could potentially be useful.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 20:54

....dammit deedee
there is a very important difference between `do {} while()` and `while ()`
```cpp
int32_t hit2 = -1;
do
{
    hit2 = diagonalMovement?GuyHitFrom(hit2+1,x+4,y+4,z,8,8,hzsz):GuyHit(hit2+1,x+7,y+7,z,2,2,hzsz);
    
    if(hit2!=-1)
    {
        if (hithero(hit2) == 0) return;
    }
} while (hit2 != -1);
```
So, what does this code do?
It sets `hit2` to `-1`
then it calls `GuyHit(0)`
err, hmm, well no, this needs to be a do-while.....
but
I see
you changed it from `GuyHit` with 6 params
which loops through every enemy and then does stuff with one when it finds it
to `GuyHit` with 7 params
which ASSUMES that the indexed enemy exists
and if no enemy exists, it... grabs the null pointer from `guys.spr(0)`
and derefs null
your `GuyHitFrom` also has this issue
both functions need to have a null check added
err, wait, no
your GuyHitFrom's for loop uses `guys.Count()`
so it should be fine
but
```cpp
int32_t GuyHit(int32_t index,int32_t tx,int32_t ty,int32_t tz,int32_t txsz,int32_t tysz,int32_t tzsz)
{
    enemy *e = (enemy*)guys.spr(index);
    
    if(e->hp > 0)
        return -1;
        
    bool d = e->dying;
    int32_t hc = e->hclk;
    e->dying = false;
    e->hclk = 0;
    bool hit = e->hit(tx,ty,tz,txsz,tysz,tzsz);
    e->dying = d;
    e->hclk = hc;
    
    return hit ? index : -1;
}```
that has no sanity check
it assumes the enemy must exist for the function to be being called
and you called it in an instance where that is unknown
(shall I fix it, or you got it?)
though err
this function doesn't seem AT ALL similar to `GuyHitFrom`
and it's called in 4-way movement
(which, yep, that's the thing; only 4-way movement quests will crash)
Did you test this at all to make sure the stomp boots actually work right in 4-way? @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
because you're calling an entirely separate function for 4-way

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 21:03

I can fix the crash, but I have no clue if the stomp boots will work at all with that fix
so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 21:04

or, wait
is the second function call just meant to be GuyHitFrom?
is that just the issue?

A multiplier of the player's base walk speed. Should probably be stored as a numerator/denominator

Might be neat as well to add an itemclass that allows you to change the speed multiplier while it's equipped. That would go well with the planned "active" passive items a la rings.

This was reported by JulianVerse in the PureZC server. We did some testing and I think have narrowed the issue to screen flags. Both Zoras and ladder screens in the quest Return to Hyrule aren't working at all. Resaving the quest in 2.53 fixed the issue. So my hypothesis is the editor is able to see what the flags should be set to, but the player is reading them incorrectly.
Here's the quest file demonstrating the issue. Just right of the start there should be a zora.

I know this is an odd one but I have a very good reason for it. In my current quest I have a room where you're awarded a Lv. 1 Wealth Medal after rescuing a prisoner, and the wealth medal comes with a letter (not the actual letter item mind you) attached it to. Now here's the underlying problem: I want to take advantage of the progressive item feature so that if you got the Lv. 1 Wealth Medal elsewhere then it will give you the Lv. 2 Wealth Medal for rescuing the prisoner and the SCC codes don't have one for only playing a follow up string if you're in a certain screen

=== @ Majora 05/05/2022 03:37

at least (non animated) GIF, and bonus for PNG. The purpose would be to be able to have crude/basic cutscenes and other visual flair. For instance, a "splash screen" when you enter a new area. This could work like enhanced music, but if possible within a subfolder. if not integrated into the quest file itself like a MIDI.

Even though ZC has generous tile space, in my opinion making cutscenes/etc. out of tiles is hideously inefficient. I make this suggestion with the assumption that it would be slightly less work in the long run to implement image importing

I know doing anything with the GUI immediately saps the will to live, so the compromise would be that images can only be displayed/manipulated via scripting. The slightly less compromise would be adding a tab to Screen Data that just asks what image to display (and the pixel coordinates of the image's top-leftmost pixel that defaults to 0,0) , and things like scrolling/rotation/whatever are left to scripting. The image would just be a simple object that draws under the hero on layer 0. bonuses include being able to have it be on other layers the way you'd do so for normal tiles. 

Image dimensions could be capped at some multiple of 256x176. Probably 3x, both for file size reasons (maybe GIF can be larger than PNG) but also not to upset allegro 4 or the ZC engine code too much. 

and uhhhh that's all I got. I can't think of other considerations but the overall point is just to have one GIF/PNG exist on a screen as a simple object.

When Editing a tile, and having used the Hookshot tool to select a rectangle of pixels, is there a way to have the "Move" gauntlet button slide only those highlighted pixels rather than the entire tile?  

They could just leave a transparent pixel in their wake after being moved.

Or is there a way to do this now, and I'm just bumbleducking my way around in a way that's not finding it?

For example, the red box on the right is what I've selected with the hookshot. I want to move it one pixel to the left, all at once.  

Instead of the "Move" button moving only the selected rectangle, it currently slides the entire tile around.

So, one note:

```
Add floating selection to tile editor
    -A 'selected' area can now be moved
    -Moving the selected area causes it to "float" above the rest of the tile
    -While floating, it does not overwrite the pixels 'below' it
    -Upon changing the selection or saving, it 'falls', merging back into the tile.

For a program that doesn't have any form of 'layers' to it's pixel editing, adding this was quite mindbending, and frankly I am completely surprised that I managed to finish it so quickly

These combos are set up as Liquid combos that require Flipper level 2 (not in quest, meant to always drown)
The top halves are solid with the Solid Is Shallow flag set.
Transitioning between screens while halfway down the combo onto the same combo will cause Link to start swimming even though he should be on the shallow part, and not be able to swim in the water regardless.

Replace _what_ specifically?  Can you give an example, @ bigjoe ?  Curiosity.

=== @ bigjoe 05/08/2022 10:01

just individual tiles. if you have a large tileset with differing tiles that need to be laid out first on a screen by screen basis, you could instead do the entire map by tiles you replace, not just the current screen. it would save... i dunno, about 7E screens worth of replacing? just do it once and the whole map has its tiles replaced. Then you can move on to secondary work like adding edges and stuff

Also, saving the quest to see if it was the old QR not working right in ZC did not change anything. Despite the flag being set, Damage Combos were still doing their base damage through Blue Ring.

=== @ Russ 05/10/2022 12:06

Previously, you could kill an enemy without them making the death SFX by moving them _far_ offscreen (such as Y = -1000) or setting their HP to very large negative numbers. Neither of these seem to work anymore; the enemy will still make the death SFX. This was working fairly recently, but seems have to broken in one of the newer alphas, though I'm not sure exactly which.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2022 12:11

"Very large negative numbers" does not do it
it specifically needs to be `HP_SILENT` from std_constants
```cpp

//NPC hit point values. Use with npc->HP to make the enemy die in a special manner.
const int HP_SILENT = -1000;  // The enemy will die without their Death Sound playing.
const int HP_GLEEOKHEAD = 1000; //Floating Gleeok heads have this as their HP value. ```

Is this a hardcoded constant or one set somewhere in the std files? I ask since it may be helpful for quest makers to be able to disable that and just kill their enemies in other ways via script if they prefer.

<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>

=== @ Orithan 05/11/2022 14:04

As it stands the only real value I can see is reading the current version of the quest
So when you do a version change you can do stuff when loading a newer version of a quest.
Min Version seems redundant because its most relevant uses, ZC does for you.

=== @ Orithan 05/11/2022 14:06

Title and Author could be fun things to use in strings so you don't have to update any ZScript strings its used in later down the track if need be
These are generally speaking very niche applications and I would not complain if they weren't added

When Deedee updated bridge combos to respect solidity map + effect square, it doesn't seem that change was reflected in the solidity preview draws. If I have a bridge that's half solid with a full effect square, it will draw as if it's fully walkable. Not a super big deal but makes testing setups a bit more awkward as I've got to walk around in the player to ensure I got it right. 

Also I'd assume this should keep the current behavior when the Old Bridge Combo Behavior rule is on. If such a thing is possible

I wasn't sure if I should put this in a new thread or just revive the old one, but to be safe I just made a new thread. I feel like it would be better if the overlay functionality was more consistent with the usage of `Shift + o` for single tile regions and large tile blocks.

I think it would make more sense for a copied 1x1 tile to be pasted into all the tiles of a selected region with `o`, and `shift + o` would only paste a single tile into the region. This would be opposite of how it works currently.

I think multi-tile copied sections should stay the same, with `o` overlaying the whole copied section, and `shift + o` only overlaying a single tile.

Of course this should extrapolate to under-laying as well but I left those key combinations out for simplicity's sake. I'm not sure how difficult this would be but assuming it is just swapping a couple of conditions around, I think it would make more sense to function this way.

ok, so
....I could have sworn conveyors were done for 1&2, but nope
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) weren't you doing that?
Armos/Grave/BS Grave I can see the reasoning for keeping those only on layer 0
because I.... do not want to imagine the enemy code changes involved in changing armos shit.
Block [weapon] combos should be simple enough to add @EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV)
Light Triggers on FFC won't work at all, because everything about the light system is grid based

Slow Walk needs some improvements in general, similar to conveyors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:21

Warps definitely make sense, though if you tried to put multiple warps in the same spot on different layers it would be wacky
(probably sanest to just make it use the top-layered warp it finds and ignore any under that)
`Step` shit is in the same block as warps, I think? Not sure how easy that'll be...
Docks could probably be done, but it doesn't seem particularly urgently useful to do, so probably not a priority

    Block Weapons - similar to Block All/Arrow/etc., but uses the Trigger flags as what to block
    Bush/Flower/Tall Grass - match sprite CSet flag, as to not have green clippings or rustles on brown grass
    Shallow Water - match sprite CSet flag
    Slow Walk - custom speed flag/attribs
    Chests - specific item flag and attribs (to work around room type and screen flag), item rises from chest flag
    Generic Pushblock - flags for pushable directions (udlr, can combine), flag for Wait (enemies), flag and attribs for specific level push, flag and attribs for "pushing animation" combo (like if you make a push block that "rolls"), frictionless flag (after pushing, moves until hits solid, liquid, pit, no push blocks, block trigger, and block hole); once solid ffc's are ready, maybe also a flag for "no gridlock", then this can be the blueprint for an in-engine Cane of Somaria```
```
Armos:
'Next Combo' flag (next instead of undercombo) [easy]
'Proximity' flag/attrib (activate within range) [not easy]```
the Block Weapons via trigger flags is something I already had floated as an idea, never got around to it

`item rises from chest` seems like a no

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 23:40

Generic Combos, when using it to spawn an enemy, does it spawn as soon as the combo appears? If so, just a new "Proximity->Next" combo type might be a good work around for the armos, just have the next combo be generic and spawn armos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:41

generic pushblock seems interesting, but would be quite a bit of work, as the entire pushing mechanic is very flag based rather than type based.
Not sure about generics, might be when triggered?
but you can set `automatically triggered` to make it trigger as soon as it appears, sooo

This is a minor thing but I think having an inbetween of the spin attack and hurricane spin would be kinda nifty, hence the tornado spin item concept. With it being quicker to charge up than the hurricane spin but only have like maybe 5 or so spins in comparison to the Hurricane Spin's 20 spins

I suppose a 3rd level of charge could be doable

the things i'd really like to see improved in charged attacks is
1. flash cset for the colourblind
2. a rule or item setting to make it not use the cost until you actually release the button (aka you can't get hit and lose the cost before you've actually let the attack rip)

If you use the Enemies->Secrets flag WITHOUT using Enemies->Secrets is Permanent, secrets no longer trigger. The secret sfx will play, but no combos flagged with secret flags actually change. It works correctly when Enemies->Secrets is Permanent is checked.
Not sure how this one happened, but it renders many quests unplayable and probably warrants a pretty quick fix

Correct
It will play the secret sound effect, but it doesn't actually trigger flags 16-31

so, `hidden_entrace()` here is the 'secret triggering function'
clearly something is wrong when `only16_31` is false.... but this was definitely working before...
Setting it to perm makes it trigger immediately, though?
because perm shouldn't affect that function at all....

=== @ Russ 05/14/2022 20:47

Basically, if you set up switch blocks in just the right way, you can soft lock yourself by walking off them

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/975417968060137502/975418011517325322/SwitchTest.qst
Here's an exampl quest to show it
Walk directly upright from the start and you'll see what I mean
Essentially, the bug happens when you have switch blocks you can walk on top of set up in an upside down L formation
If you start on the bottom block, four pixels up from the grid, and walk up right, when you fall off, you'll be stuck
In the example linked, the block Link starts on is at position 64, 96
Link begins at position 64, 92
Walking up and right, he'll fall off and become trapped at 72, 84 and forced to F6
I'm sure that anything that gets him at position 72, 84 would do it. This was just the easiest way I could find to replicate it
The magic value here appears to be four pixels above the central positioning of the L

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/17/2022 00:37

Thiiis.... is annoying as hell
since you don't have large hitbox on, it's checking y+12
as link's `center of collision`
which... happens to be 96, inside the next combo down, which isn't a switchblock
so it has you 'fall'
...but standard solidity code won't let you slip out of that corner.
Fucking FUN

Instead it uses the screen's undercombo and does not apply the Continuous property to it.

Technically, in that is says `Identical to Tall Grass`, that does use undercombo, and things that use undercombo.... can't really be continuous as they would be infinite loops of instant crash, this is behaving exactly as that documentation says it should

Well, the same combo ID will always be synced

Separate combos on the screen.... don't actually animate
how combos work is
each COMBO ID in the WHOLE QUEST animates
multiple combos of the same ID makes no difference, they reference the same timer and frame info as each other

=== @ cbailey78 05/16/2022 16:56

I think it should be to animate at random frames within a specified number of frames.  Have it a checkbox option in the combo editor.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 17:01

care to actually elaborate on that?

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 18:56

I'm assuming like a "Randomize Start Frame" flag (not start tile) and/or being able to specifically set which frame the animation starts on (again, not starting tile). I'm guessing the general idea is to make different variations of a 4 frame animation, without having to setup every variation in the tile page. I had a similar request with using negative numbers in the A.frames as to move backwards in the tile page (like for opening and closing door animations)

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 18:58

A.Delay like in items would be neat for combos too

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 05/16/2022 20:44

Personally, to emulate this randomized behavior, I just relegate my animation data to combo cycling pairs of identical animation sets. 

I.e. if you have a torch with four frames of animation, I'd copy each of those four tiles next to itself to go from 1234 to 11223344, and make the "1" tiles animate for two frames then cycle into the "2" combo, which is two frames, etc. 

 So I'd have four combos
instead of just one combo, and I can put down any of the four combos I want, wherever I want.
And they'd all animate separately but similarly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 20:52

^
Do you even need the duplicate tiles?
Does a 1-frame animation not work?

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 05/16/2022 20:56

I can try that real quick, probably.

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 21:05

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Does a 1-frame animation not…"): For combo cycling, yes, or at least should. The default tileset uses 1 frame animation for cycling a "weapon cooldown (block all)" in the crystal switches

When writing to lweapon->Level with a script, enemies damaged by power 0 weapons do not take damage equal to `Level * 2` like I would expect. Instead they take 1 damage. I'm able to write to the value and read the correct result, so it's not read only, the damage calculations just don't seem to care.

## Re-Used Bush FFC's Don't Respond to Scripted Swords (#1432)

=== @ mitchfork 05/19/2022 16:40

This is an unhinged bug unearthed by doing some frankly irresponsible shit but I do think it's a real bug

If you have a "Bush->Next" FFC on the screen, it reacts to scripted weapons with "lweapon->Weapon = LW_SWORD" and goes to the next combo normally

If you then reset the FFC->Data to the bush combo, it will NOT react to scripted weapons with "lweapon->Weapon = LW_SWORD" but WILL react to a normal sword item
Can provide a test quest if needed

=== @ aslion 05/19/2022 16:53

I wanna pop in and add that FFC Bush->Next combos seem to have weird behavior in general, sometimes the dropped items and leaf animations will spawn up to a tile over from where the bush was cut. Can create a separate bug report if needed

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 05/21/2022 21:39

I was just trying to set up a Signpost that uses the room's String as its string.  I hit 's' to set the room's string to string #1, then hit "done."  But it didn't work in-game.

Then I went into the Room Data pane and was able to set the string there, and that worked fine.

This isn't a bug.  This is just idiot-proofing the Strings pane to not look like we're setting the **room's** string rather than editing any string. 

This would only affect the "s" window's header bar that says "Edit Message string"  to turn it into "Edit Message strings"  That's all.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 05/21/2022 21:41

The only reason this is happening is because we used to assign strings to a room with "s" but now it brings up the Strings editor, which is good.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/21/2022 21:42

I... am confused as to how you thought the string editor was assigning a single room's string, and doubt a single `s` in a title would make that much of a difference....
but, on the other hand, changing 1 letter is such a small level of work, that there's no reason NOT to do it....

I'm surprised this hasn't been reported yet but I've been running into a peculiar bug where link's falling down a hole animation plays twice when falling down a hole.

....what??

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/22/2022 01:36

Yeah. I've been noticing it on my end especially when falling down bottomless pits from certain directions

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 01:36

What animation style (can you test them all?)

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/22/2022 01:49

I'm using the BS Animation Style for my link and I have just finished flighing myself into a hole in multiple directions, it plays fine when you're falling into a hole from the west (right) but plays twice when falling into a hole from the east (left), north (down) and south (up)

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/22/2022 01:51

curiously enough, this glitch actually also shows up in the player sprite editor as well.

=== @ Moosh 05/22/2022 02:54

Falling down pits has an unusual number of frames across all animation styles. So could it be that instead of a 7(?) frame animation you're playing a 4 frame animation multiple times or something?

=== @ Moosh 05/22/2022 02:57

Which could also explain it being different for different directions because some directions would hit blank tiles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 03:20

@ Moosh that, in fact, would be exactly the issue
@ FireSeraphim you have the tiles set up wrong
falling is 7 frames

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 03:21

it's "playing twice" because it's doing the 4 tiles for that dir, then 3 tiles from the next dir

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/22/2022 03:21

Strange, I was under the impression it was 3-frames since the right facing one seems to play correctly. I think an option to force a 3-frame falling animation for link would be ideal.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 03:21

and facing right doesn't play twice, because there isn't another dir after right, so those are blank tiles

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/977720139321589781/977773316163141642/unknown.png)
Right is playing those 7 tiles

=== @ Moosh 05/22/2022 03:22

So the way to do 3 frames is...yeah that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 03:22

Now, since you don't actually have any difference between different directions here, you could just set all 4 dirs to use the one set of 7 tiles

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/977720139321589781/977773730052841493/unknown.png)

this would fix it, where all 4 dirs are set to the same tile
or, you could add more frames to the animation to stretch it out
Falling takes 70 frames, with aspeed of 10
thus 7 tiles

Would be cool if there was an option to specify the speed of slow walk combos, or alternatively a new combo type that does that. I see the benefits of both having the speed change be multiplicative versus a specific value, so it may be worth having both be an option. This would also allow for "fast-walk" combos, which might have utility in puzzles or combat.

most of this type of thing uses `keepdata` bool

zinfo is based on the quest header
.....which ALWAYS has keepdata to true?
Which confuses me, as how the fuck does that not also overwrite your header info when grabbing tiles?

Turns out, the `header` info is read when you grab

zinfo was lumped in with header, but, it read to the main thing, as no temp was passed
adding a separate skip flag... allows it to grab the header but NOT zinfo

I think I found a way to somewhat consistently trigger the crash, you need to create a save file and make sure A, B, and Y are enabled as re-assignable item buttons (basically the same setup as my wip) and make sure to have a few inventory items in your inventory before making a save, then restart ZC and load the save file. Then press a after loading the file.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 05/23/2022 09:29

I have no idea how processor-intensive this will be, so definitely feel free to disregard if it's outlandish or difficult!

Currently, in the tile editor, we can click and drag the sword cursor to place/edit individual pixels as we move the mouse over them.  

Imagine if we could do the same with the fill bucket tool.  We could bulk erase so many things at once.  But this would probably be very cpu-intensive or something.

Would it be possible to just cut the amount of frames it "checks" for that tool in half to save resources or something?

I just figure this ability would make it so much faster to modify tiles or erase large portions of a tile without needing to switch tools to the Hookshot to select a rectangle, then switch to the red wand tool.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2022 10:52

and have it like
still work the way you'd want

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 05/23/2022 13:25

As expected.  And there's no way to make it perform one action per 5 frames or something instead of checking every proverbial frame, right?   Still, I appreciate the feedback.

Why would this hurt performance to any significant degree?

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 05/23/2022 18:15

Not that I'd know or anything, but common sense dictates that with every click, it's checking for every pixel-block next to the current clicked one, and every one next to that, and next to that, and that, and that, and so on.  A flood operation must be quite a significant one.  Now imagine holding in the button, doing that operation every proverbial frame.

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 05/23/2022 18:24

256 checks a second for a program that runs capped at 60 fps
in a program made in C++(?)
not to mention the fact that the fill tool already works as-is, it would just have to not stop filling once you touched a new color

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 05/23/2022 18:26

if efficiency was such a big concern it could keep a cache of the previous color the mouse was over and only do the fill operation if the color the mouse is currently over is different to that as well as the currently selected mouse color

2) An extra SFX slot for when it hits a combo that isn't a hookshot combo (clonk!) <https://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/OOT/OOT_Sword_Clang2.wav>

=== @ Majora 05/25/2022 00:57

3) Strafing with the hookshot, which happens by pressing and holding the hookshot button. Behaves similarly to charging your sword and you can't turn around until releasing the button and the hookshot fires. This behavior toggled by item editor checkbox (or attribyte if there's no spare unused checkboxes)
(alright maybe I lied a little bit and that's a big one, but mostly I want the THUNK! and CLONK!)

=== @ Majora 05/25/2022 01:00

3a) An attribyte field to specify frame delay of hookshot button holding before arming hookshot and going into strafing mode (turbo optional; a delay of 30-45 frames internally otherwise)

=== @ Majora 05/25/2022 01:01

4) an extra SFX slot for the arming sound that signifies strafing mode is a-go <https://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/OOT/OOT_Hookshot_Set.wav>
and that's it I promise. gonna attach links to the specific SFX I mean to maybe illustrate things better.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2022 01:21

items have 2 sfx slots, so more than 2 sfx on items would require an expansion

=== @ Moosh 05/26/2022 00:07

I know modules are kinda trash and mostly unsupported, but somebody was asking about changing the title screen graphics and so I took a look at the "default" one for reference on what modules can actually change. There's some quirks with the title screen fadeout but far more noticeable, all the items in the intro scroll draw in the wrong palette. They appear to be using the Zelda 1 palette instead of Koten. Unsure if this is a case of Zoria fucked up and forgot to assign the right palette or Zoria _really_ fucked up and didn't remove some hardcodes.

Attack Rings might be problematic - what items' attack do they increase? Critical Ring per-ring items only work because Critical Rings only affect three items to begin with, so there's enough flags to handle each one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 05:38

perpendicular knockback with engine enemies will make them able to clip into walls

(meta) thread name was changed: ❌🔒(QR) Improved Enemy Knockback

I thought they had collision detection with solid combos though? When you knock them back normally

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 16:56

Also, all enemies have collision detection with "no enemies"-flagged combos, even diagonally-moving enemies

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 16:58

the problem is
if they start moving left
then they won't do another solidity check until they are one whole tile left
so
if you hit it PERPENDICULAR
you can hit it right next to a solid wall
in a direction it is moving
and it can walk right through it
because it already checked solidity before the knockback

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 17:00

Wait, how does the quarter-tile enemy solidity check bugfix work then?

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 17:01

Is it that they can only walk onto a combo whose ENTIRE bottom half is walkable? A combo with the left or right side being walkable but not the other would be counted as fully solid by them, even if they were knocked back into the walkable portion they wouldn't actually touch that part and act as though the whole thing was a wall?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 17:04

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) would you be capable of doing this?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/16/2022 05:30

my solution to this is to just make afreeform walking enemy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/16/2022 05:32

the big thing is figuring out what values would be useful; random rate and etc don't really work as 16 big values when it's being checked every frame, and LttP enemies seem to instead move in ranges of frames before turning as opposed to tile-based movement

=== @ P-Tux7 07/16/2022 06:07

this would also entail either making a second leever class as well or putting leevers in that freeform walking enemy class
the thing is i don't mind the enemies being on the 16x16 grid... just that you can't knock them sideways (and then they auto snap back to the grid)
BS Zelda has this and it's very nice

=== @ P-Tux7 07/16/2022 06:09

still, thanks a ton for considering it
should make scriptless enemies a whole lot more fun to use

Dungeon Minimaps are offset 1 pixel to the left between the Dmap Editor and the Subscreen. It's been this way for a while. I suggest changing it everywhere else to make it consistent with the tiles used for overworld maps

Quoting from another channel:
```So a bit of an optimization question. Say I have three bitmaps: two textures A and B, and an output bitmap.
Image
I want to fill in the green color of bitmap B with the texture of bitmap A and then put the output in bitmap C. I also don't want to overwrite any of the data in A and B in the process
Is there a way to do with without introducing a fourth bitmap?
Also the pink in this case is color 0```
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/982138836320682054/982138838321336360/Sprite-0003.png)

=== @ Moosh 06/03/2022 04:31

This would be made easier with a version of MaskedDraw that uses a second bitmap as a texture instead of drawing a fixed color. It would also be nice to have some finer control over which colors are masked if possible. Right now it's anything that isn't color 0, but in the example case the optimal use would be a single color or the inverse of that color's space. Dunno how doable that is. MaskedBlit is the main request here.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 10:32

```cpp
void MaskedDraw( int layer, bitmap mask, int color );
 * Draws 'color' to the bitmap, on any pixels that are non-color-0 on the mask.
 * The mask's `0,0` is overlayed at `0,0` of the destination.
void MaskedDraw( int layer, bitmap mask, int color, int maskColor );
 * Same as above, but instead of any non-0 pixels, pixels that match 'maskColor' are used
void MaskedDraw( int layer, bitmap mask, int color, int startMaskColor, int endMaskColor );
 * Same as above, but colors c such that 'startMaskColor <= c <= endMaskColor' will be used
 *  as the mask.

void MaskedBlit( int layer, bitmap mask, bitmap pattern, bool repeatPattern );
void MaskedBlit( int layer, bitmap mask, bitmap pattern, bool repeatPattern, int maskColor );
void MaskedBlit( int layer, bitmap mask, bitmap pattern, bool repeatPattern, int startMaskColor, int endMaskColor );
 * Same as 'MaskedDraw', but instead of drawing a color to the masked portions, draws from
 * a supplied 'pattern' bitmap.
 * If 'repeatPattern' is false, the pattern will be drawn at `0,0` with the width/height of the
 *     pattern bitmap, and nowhere else.
 * If 'repeatPattern' is true, the pattern will repeat in a tiled manner, starting from `0,0`,
 *     up to the width/height of the destination bitmap.
 * 'repeatPattern' does not affect the mask bitmap.```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 10:38

@ Moosh would love a test on these

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 10:39

Also, curious if using a bitmap as a mask for itself would work
i.e.
`foo->MaskedBlit(0, foo, pattern, false, 0x52);`

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 10:40

I'd be happy to do some tests but it'll have to be later tonight. Don't let me forget. Drag my ass in there 🤣

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 10:41

if `foo` here were your face with the green, and `pattern` were your left bitmap, this should create your right bitmap, if I am correct
though, if you don't want to modify the green face one, you'd first want to just standard blit that to a copy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:00

Splendid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:31

so here I have a pattern (actually an array of patterns)
I have `bitmap face` which is the middle one
and then `bitmap foo` which is the bottom
```cpp
if(Hero->PressA)
{
    foo->Clear(0);
    face->Blit(0, foo, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false);
    pat = RandGen->Rand(NUM_TILES-1);
    foo->MaskedBlit(1, foo, patterns[pat], true, MASK_COLOR);
}
```
On pressing A, it clears foo, copies face to foo, picks a random pattern, and masks it

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:31

Does Screen have these functions as well?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:31

no, screen does not

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:32

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:32

which, given that these don't have any `x/y`, would be difficult to make useful

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:32

Ohhh that's true

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:32

It uses whichever is smaller of the target bitmap and the mask bitmap (smaller width and smaller height)

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:32

Was thinking ways to remove one more bitmap, but that'd complicate things some

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:33

If the `bool repeats` is false, it also will limit to the pattern bitmap's size
otherwise it tiles the destination with the pattern
here it specifies a singular `MASK_COLOR`, so only that color is replaced
seems to all work pretty nicely
also, I'm not adding a 'patterned' version of `Dither()`
you can basically do that yourself just by using `Dither` with a special color (one not used in the tile), and then `MaskedBlit`'ing that color

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:35

Yeah that's sensible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:36

The fun thing is, I set these up to avoid a lot of duplicate code

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:36

If I wanted to do that even without MaskedBlit, dither can do color 0 as well right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:36

Yes, you can dither color 0 onto things
Keep in mind that color 0 being transparent
....is a version of masking.
so, it's the same basic logic as MaskedBlit

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:37

Yeah, same idea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:38

Now for the neat thing
Script draw commands
How do they handle their arguments?
Well, they store all of their arguments in an array
so what do I do here that's fancy?
```cpp
case BMPMASKBLIT:
{
    set_user_bitmap_command_args(j, 4);
    script_drawing_commands[j][5] = 0x01 * 10000L;
    script_drawing_commands[j][6] = 0xFF * 10000L;
    script_drawing_commands[j][17] = SH::read_stack(ri->sp+4);
    break;
}
case BMPMASKBLIT2:
{
    set_user_bitmap_command_args(j, 5);
    script_drawing_commands[j][6] = script_drawing_commands[j][5];
    script_drawing_commands[j][0] = BMPMASKBLIT;
    script_drawing_commands[j][17] = SH::read_stack(ri->sp+5);
    break;
}
case BMPMASKBLIT3:
{
    set_user_bitmap_command_args(j, 6);
    script_drawing_commands[j][0] = BMPMASKBLIT;
    script_drawing_commands[j][17] = SH::read_stack(ri->sp+6);
    break;
}
```
So, if you call `MaskBlit()` with 4 params,
it basically just calls the 6 param version
with `0x01, 0xFF`
The 5 param version, calls the 6 param version by duplicating the parameter, so it has a range of just the one color

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:40

Nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:40

and they all set their 'command' back to `BMPMASKBLIT`, so the code in `script_drawing.cpp` doesn't even know which one it's running
they all work identically
Same effect for `BMPMASKDRAW`

=== @ Moosh 06/03/2022 05:52

The offset from Screen->Quake screws up draws sometimes. Good example being scripted subscreens. Since they freeze the screen, all draws are offset by whatever the quake offset was for that frame, which is really noticeable and awkward. It'd be nice if we could read the current offset in ZScript to counteract the effect

Trigger self flag works fine, but the intended conjoint with the screen flags Hit All Triggers -> Perm Secret / 16-31 does not
I was confused why it did not act as expected
-> Perm Secret works
it sets the secret state, so if you leave and re-enter the screen the secret is triggered
16-31 *does not* proceed
...unless Enemies->Secret is Permanenet is also checked
which seems like it should have absolutely nothing to do with it.
This has been the behaviour in ZC for a while, I believe. Since I recall it being a pain to set up before.

A combo type whose selected "triggers" instead block/kill said LWeapons. Highly recommended to work on layers so we can make it invisible and put it on top of other combo types/in aliases. This would also allow it to be used in conjunction with the combo on the layer below it, to have that combo be triggerable by some things, then have this combo above it blocking others. And once that combo is triggered, secrets can be used to make the blocker combo disappear. A possible neat thing would be to make Self-Triggering combos also trigger the Barrier combo above them, making it go to the Next combo without needing Screen Secrets.

Games like LTTP have certain weapons (boomerang, arrows, magic) killed by ordinary solid walls, and I think with the use of aliases this would be the most elegant way to let the user customize with what weapons that sort of thing happens, and determine what combos count as "solid" enough to block weapons as well.

You can now make `Min level` for triggers instead act as `Max level` (changes the text when you toggle the checkbox)
the new combo type blocks weapons that match the triggers
So, a `Max Level 2` block with arrows checked will stop silver arrows but not gold arrows
Also, this combo type has an Attribyte `Block SFX`, which allows setting a sound to play when a weapon is blocked.
If `Triggers Secrets`, `->Next`, or `->Prev` are checked, they should trigger when a weapon is blocked, as per normal triggerflag rules that work on all combotypes.

and just tested
with new qr on
block combos do indeed work on layer 6
(the new custom ones, specifically, nothing done for the old ones)
The thing is, trigger flags work for every combo type
The `automatic trigger` and `button trigger` both run through one function, while the `weapon triggers` run through another
because the weapon ones need the `weapon *w`
so, this just adds in the weapon trigger function, and if it triggers, it kills the weapon, playing the sfx from attribyte 0, and continues through any other trigger effects set for the combo.
If you trigger one of these via a buttonpush or autotrigger, it will *not* play the blocking sfx, as it didn't block a weapon specifically

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ P-Tux7

1. Layering a Block Weapon combo over a triggerable combo to create the appearance of a single tile that blocks magic but is triggered by arrows. Seems perfectly possible with this new QR, great job

2. Having the self-triggered combo on Layer 0 "tell" combos above it to self-trigger as well. Is this not possible to write?

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 01:29

Either way, thanks a ton for this. Not only does it add versimilitude by making combos feel more solid, but it also adds puzzle opportunities by making specific projectiles blocked and having to get rid of the blocking combo or push the block out of the way.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 08:21

OK, not sure I entirely understood everything you're asking
`1.` should be good, yeah
Keep in mind that if the triggerable combo is set to be triggered by magic, and the block also blocks magic, that the magic will then be blocked AND trigger the combo below; the block does not prevent the trigger
`2.` is a nope (not because it's "impossible", but because there's no clean / "non-jank" way to set that up)

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 19:13

So the only way to change the Block Weapon combo after you trigger the combo below it is screen secrets?
I wonder how you're supposed to do things like bush combos that can also block other weapons.
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Keep in mind that if the trig…"): I don't plan to do anything like this because it wouldn't make sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:21

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "So the only way to change the…"): or if the combo below it is a crystal switch, using the switch blocks ability to modify other layers

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 20:27

i think that isn't really efficient for single instances like bushes is it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:28

no
hmm
the thing is, it isn't like bushes `trigger` in the same sense as triggerflags, so hooking into that is a pain

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 20:33

ohh sorry
err wait i meant generic combos that act like bushes, y'know? (goes to next combo after triggering, doesn't trigger screen stuff)
or is that what you meant

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:34

bleh, I hate generic combos
they are a mess
even so, the question is how to tell it what to do
because, if you just want to say `triggering this combo also triggers the combo on layer x`
that won't work the way you expect
because then you're using the `->Next` flag on the barrier combo
and doing that means it will go to the next thing when it is triggered... including by a weapon it blocks

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 20:36

oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:36

so you'd instead need some arbitrary way to have triggering a combo edit another layer

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/10/2022 20:36

Generic Combos need an overhaul tbh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:36

and that sounds way to complicated to be at all intuitive to use

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 20:36

wait how would it trigger if the barrier combo blocks it, and the combo on the layer below isn't triggered by it?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/10/2022 20:36

But I don't know what that overhaul would look like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:37

In this situation, that wouldn't remove the combo below, but it WOULD remove the barrier
which would then not work as expected
so regardless, it isn't easy to do
HOWEVER
```cpp
combodata script alterLayer
{
    void run(int layer, int offset)
    {
        mapdata md = Game->LoadTempScreen(layer);
        md->ComboD[this->Pos] += offset;
    }
}```
2 line script solves your problem
put that on the "stump" combo that appears after the bush is cut
with the layer the barrier is on as the `layer` parameter
and, an offset of `1` to make the barrier go to `next`
or, instead
```cpp
combodata script setLayer
{
    void run(int layer, int comboid)
    {
        mapdata md = Game->LoadTempScreen(layer);
        md->ComboD[this->Pos] = comboid;
    }
}```
just replace it with a specific combo, like say, combo 0
combo scripts are really useful for this stuff

I just set `forceFitW = true` for both of them
so, their width is not accounted for in calculating the column's width, and their width is then forced to the column's calculated width.
The problem being, the default width of a textfield, is based on it's starting value
so without that to override the width, it scaled with the input

You can make unique triggers in the combo editor now, which is convenient. But they do not respect the Trigger->Self Only flag.

What it says on the tin. I think this was something planned that was never made. You can of course just script triggers, but since the LW_SCRIPT weapon pointers are now used kinda dynamically for custom stuff, this being in-engine and functional as expected would be nice.

You can make individual combos trigger screen secrets with these weapon types now, but it kind creates this weird separate environment where the trigger is on the combo, not the flag.

An item that let's you sets the divisor of any counter (including customs). With item bundles, there's no worrying about if a single item could effect multiple counters at once, just put different divisor items in an item bundle

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/06/2022 22:32

because every counter
needs to be a separate class

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i think i've requested a magi…"): The problem is, dividing your magic use isn't even. If you use the drain rate multiplier properly (which is what half magic uses), you can create whatever divisors you want, with scripts; allowing half, quarter, eighth, etc magic
that's the best way to handle it
You can do it without any scripts if you use "Learn Half Magic" rooms, which, with compat qrs off, will halve the drain rate each time
with scripts you can do much more
## New Combo  - Steps (#1474)

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 06/06/2022 23:00

I'm only suggesting this because conveyors exist at the moment. (So something _similar_ can kind of be done maybe.)  

A "Steps" Combo  (Rather than a Step->Next Combo.)  is a combo that adjusts the player's position based on the direction they're moving.

For example, if I have a Steps combo shaped like ``` / ``` I would set its offset to `y = -1` for every pixel to the right I moved, which would move them upward by the same amount.  Or if it was a shallow step, I'd set it to  `y = -.5` for a half step up.

The combo would require customizable options rather than be something hardcoded because of the following:

1)  Its uses are flexible.  There are 8 directions steps could go in.  Wind could push someone in a specific direction.  They could walk into or against the wind and have different movement effects based on it.
2)  It could have the ability to lock certain cardinal directions from being moved in while on a particular stair combo.
3)  It differs from a conveyor in that when the player isn't moving, nothing is happening. They just stand still.  Even conveyors can't do that.

Especially now that we have X and Y buttons to work with, it would be nice to be able to have "Only Selected" counters that only show up when the item is assigned to the appropriate button.

## Hidden Bomb Item Unslectable With Delay (#1479)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 06/10/2022 17:42

The title isn't even close to the full story. The bug is that if the Bomb Item is hidden in the Subscreen, and then the Player gets Bomb Capacity and Ammo from an Item and the now should be revealed Bomb Item would occupy an empty subscreen button... it doesn't, until some sort of game update (like changing screens)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 06/10/2022 17:43

By Hidden, I mean the QR `No Ammo Required to Display Subscreen Items` is toggled off, but the player also starts with the Bomb Item (set to give the player no Ammo or Capacity), and the Game Init has Bomb Ammo Capacity start at 0.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 06/10/2022 17:45

If the player then picks up an item that increases Bomb Capacity over 0 (and also gives ammo), like a Bomb Bag, and the player has an empty button slot in their subscreen, the Bomb Item does not occupy the empty button slot, *and* does not appear in the Active Subscreen.
Upon changing screens, the game updates, and the Bomb Item will appear in the Button Slot and the Active Inventory now.
I put together a test quest to demonstrate this.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984875140997316608/984876293009047633/SpawnChanger.qst
So, if you just go one screen north and get the Bomb bag, you'll see this bug in action.
If you grab the Wand first, which goes into Slot B, then go for the Bomb Bag, the bug does not occur.
## Specify Command Category in Docs (#1480)

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 06/10/2022 19:08

Bit of a weird request, but it would be helpful if in the docs they specified which category (namespace?) functions were in, e.g. `Game`, `Screen`, etc. Sometimes I forget whether a specific function falls under a specific category and I have to scroll back up to where that section is defined. If each function just listed what type it was it would be helpful. For example, instead of:
```npc CreateNPC(int id);            ZASM Instruction: 
                    CREATENPCR
                    CREATENPCV

/**
* Creates an npc of the given type at (0,0). Use the NPC_ constants in
* std.zh to pass into this method. The return value is a pointer to the
* new NPC.
* The maximum number of NPCs on any given screen is 255. ZC will report an
* error to allegro.log if you try to create NPCs after reaching that maximum.
*
*/ Example Use: !#!```

It was something like:
```namespace: Screen
npc CreateNPC(int id);            ZASM Instruction: 
                    CREATENPCR
                    CREATENPCV

/**
* Creates an npc of the given type at (0,0). Use the NPC_ constants in
* std.zh to pass into this method. The return value is a pointer to the
* new NPC.
* The maximum number of NPCs on any given screen is 255. ZC will report an
* error to allegro.log if you try to create NPCs after reaching that maximum.
*
*/ Example Use: !#!```
(Note the extra line of text at the top. If not `namespace`, whatever the appropriate term would be).

I'm not sure how difficult this would be to add, I'm hoping it would be a fairly easy thing to automate but I don't know how the docs are made so I realize how it may be more tedium than is a priority.

I think we should have a random side warp like the random tile warp.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 10:24

This would be cool
but
it would NOT be easy to implement
sidewarps have 4 states now, which is an even spacing of 2 bits, and they are packed in tightly
so it would require adding more memory to screen, and re-organizing the bit storage of the sidewarp/tilewarp data
...and making sure that gives the proper values to zscript still
Technically doable, but, a lot of work

=== @ Moosh 06/21/2022 11:25

Currently the only available Game Over/F6 screen uses some mildly esoteric terminology to anybody who isn't accustomed to Zelda 1. There's an alt Save screen accessible to ZScript with `ShowSaveScreen()` that has more descriptive labels and a warning prompt when quitting out. I figure it'd be nice for new users (and hopefully easy) to have a quest rule that swaps out the standard F6 menu for one of these.

=== @ P-Tux7 06/21/2022 18:25

My vote is for allowing the strings to be replaced (not actual strings just words) in Game Data or whatever because that would also help with translating quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/21/2022 18:55

`ShowSaveScreen()` is from save point combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/21/2022 18:56

and is completely different code to the normal save menu
and all of this stuff
is super janky
and frankly, F6 scripts exist for fully-customizable scripted F6 menus

The thought was for the (alarmingly high) number of people who can't manage even just compiling database scripts

=== @ Moosh 06/22/2022 00:51

But if it wasn't as smartly coded as it should be, that's fine. I assumed if the menu could be called up via a single function in ZScript it must be just as simple internally. Evidently not

=== @ Russ 06/25/2022 14:55

In particular, ffcscript.zh 2.0.1 had two versions of CountFFCsRunning, one that took "char32 ptr" as an argument, another that took "int scriptnum" as an argument. 2.0.2 only has the latter function. Scripts will still compile fine, but any call of CountFFCsRunning that uses a string will simply fail to function. This appears to be the case for most functions in the header.
This feels particularly bad as it doesn't throw any error messages, so users would be none the wiser. Scripts that used the old functions that took a string as an argument simply stop functioning

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/26/2022 20:43

Which scripts used that version?
It really isn't efficient to be using a string literal every time anyway
but, they were removed due to a separate issue
Also, the version with strings was NEVER posted anywhere, it was only included in the ZC package, hidden in a damn folder. I literally didn't know it existed until it caused compile errors with something else for Moosh.
There is a new function at the top, which takes the string, and returns the script ID. Using that is far preferred, as it also has an included error message indicating that the script was not assigned to a slot, which is much MORE user friendly for people setting up database scripts.
So, intentional update, of a header that was never posted in the DB, because Zoria wrote his update to it poorly.

## Item Pickup flags being not being readable or writable (#1493)

In 2.53, Zoria made certain Item->Pickup flags (most notably IP_FADE) read/writeable by script. This change does not appear to have made its way to 2.55, leading to inconsistent behaviour. It would be great if they could once again be made accessible by scripts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/26/2022 20:49

Err @ Russ
the code blocks I'm seeing in 2.53 and 2.55 for `itemsprite->Pickup` are identical

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/26/2022 20:52

https://pastebin.com/xpAr9yCK (2.53)
https://pastebin.com/PzMkdheR (2.55)
my only guess would be this:```cpp
        if (( FFCore.GetQuestVersion() == 0x250 && FFCore.GetQuestBuild() < 33 ) //this ishowit looks in 2.53.1, Beta 25
            || ( FFCore.GetQuestVersion() < 0x250  ))
        {
            newpickup &= ~(ipBIGRANGE | ipCHECK | ipMONEY | ipBIGTRI | ipNODRAW | ipFADE);
        }```
which means, notably, that older quests need to be re-saved in a newer version in order to allow these to be writable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/26/2022 21:06

So, the question here is, what's actually wrong here? It looks all right...

=== @ Russ 06/26/2022 21:22

```item1->Pickup |= 64;```
This is what is set in my 2.53 quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/26/2022 22:38

So yeah, this is janky as absolute shit and Zoria has no clue what he's doing
and needs to be re-written at some point....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/26/2022 20:41

When interacting with a dialog in a way that causes it to call for a redraw, you are able to see as each individual proc refreshes.

Realistically, it should not be drawing anything to the actual screen until `update_hw_screen()` is next called, which SHOULD prevent this flickering as everything redraws; blaming A5 upgrade for this, not sure what the hell is the specific cause though. @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

what was wrong?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/27/2022 01:08

BTW, the issue was this:

Allegro legacy a5_display is now what draws to the actual screen, in its own thread. call it the display thread.

update_hw_screen blits the main screen to the bitmap that the display thread draws from. This only happens on the main thread

Notice there is a thread contention issue here, two threads can't access this bitmap at the same time

The gui code already resolved that by doing acquire_screen / release_screen in the gui code, within each components handling the for MSG_DRAW event.

However, it wasn't wrapping the entire check_for_redraw logic in a similar lock/release, which meant that the display thread would very likely do a redraw while the gui code was only partially done doing its thing

## ✅🔒Reassessing the sideview solid spike collision situation (#1497)
@ Moosh opened this issue on 06/28/2022

Status: fixed

Labels: ['bug']

Source: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/991186907318997012



=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:42

So this is an old argument I had with Zoria where I reported the same bug to him in three different circumstances and couldn't get him to budge on the current sideview damage combo collision code being broken and unacceptable. Best I could do at the time was talk him into adding the `Sideview Spike Detection Prior to 2.50.1RC1` compat rule. Emily asked about this in another channel though, so I figured it'd a good time to re-evaluate the behavior and talk about changing it again (FIXED fixed sideview damage combo collision, hooray)

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:45

So Exhibit A: Link will take damage stepping just one toe out onto this platform when a spiked combo is next to it. The combo does not to be solid flush with the platform, it just needs to be there at all. This is absolutely garbage for gameplay reasons but I can at least see Zoria's argument for the behavior being correct. There is a spike there and Link is touching it. Okay fine.
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/991186907318997012/991187450946928740/zc_screen00181.png)
Exhibit B: I have now moved the platform up half a tile. Link still takes damage while walking out over the spike. Absolute madman shit here, it's not even remotely colliding
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/991186907318997012/991187698993872976/zc_screen00182.png)

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:47

Exhibit C: Same as above, but this time the spike is an FFC moving upwards. Here it hits me once again a full half a tile below me
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/991186907318997012/991187969656504371/zc_screen00183.png)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 03:47

oh fun
So is that with or without the current QR checked?
And what does the other state DO?

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:48

This is with the compat rule unchecked. With it checked none of this happens but solid damage combos don't work in sideview at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 03:48

oh
fun

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:49

Zoria insisted at the time that extending Link's hitbox down a full half tile in sideview was just the only reasonable way to do it. I can't say I don't believe him that rewriting this collision would be a lot of work but he had to be smashed out of his mind to think this was a good look for the engine

=== @ tim 06/28/2022 03:50

i cant even begin to wrap my head around that
totally disagree with that

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:50

Incidentally this discussion I believe was what drove me to write this script: https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=354

=== @ tim 06/28/2022 03:51

ideally damage combos in sideview should have some leeway
stuff like screen A and B should never hurt

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:52

I would agree. I'd say half of Link's sprite should be standing on the solid damage before it can hurt

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 03:52

yeah, this is.... bleh
I can see why zoria did what he did

=== @ tim 06/28/2022 03:53

ideally some kind of falling should contribute to actually hitting the spikes

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:53

I don't think the fix itself was his doing at least. This was added before he came on as dev, he just refused to fix it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 03:53

(Keeping in mind, afaik, what he did was not make it hit you lower- I don't think he was responsible for that, it's old?)
yeah
he just gave no fix, which is understandable
because
this
is a fucking MESS

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:54

I haven't made a sideview quest in a long while and the compat rule does work for my purposes. So no rush here
Just thought this was worth bringing up again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 03:55

I feel like the answer
would be to add `x+8,y+16` as an exact pixel check
and nothing else

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:57

That makes sense. Though I'd do different pixel checks depending on Link's direction since +8 isn't centered
+7 for left, +8 for right, +7&+8 for up/down

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 04:00

The other thing is that solid and nonsolid damage combos are using the same collision code right now I think. Ideally Link should be doing one pass for nonsolid combos using his full combo collision rect and then a second pass for solid using reasonable points along the edges of his hitbox

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:09

errr
check combo rules for `"Better Sideview Damage Combo Detection"`
and tell me if that does anything
because I think that's a deedee addition

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:12

@ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 04:12

Oh!
be funny if I just goldfish brained and Deedee already fixed this one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:13

and I don't know how it works at all, because it isn't in the function I was just trying to edit to add this
so if that like, works
```cpp
{ "Better Sideview Damage Combo Detection", qr_LESS_AWFUL_SIDESPIKES, 
    "When enabled, damage combos in sideview will only do their"
    " check if the Player is standing on solid ground and is"
    " mostly on the damage combo. This does not affect the"
    " check for bonking your head on a damaging ceiling; see"
    " 'Sideview Spike Detection Prior to 2.50.1RC3' for that."},
```

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 04:15

That seems to break solid spike top surfaces altogether?
never mind I'm a dumbass, was messing with effect squares 🤦

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:16

pffft
effect squares would do that

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 04:17

Yeah this is basically exactly the behavior I wanted. I guess the only bug here is when I went to make a test quest to confirm the bug was still there, this rule wasn't on by default

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:19

haha

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 04:19

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:19

*holds CTRL+Z to undo 10 minutes of coding*
There's literally a function `alwaysOnRules()` for things like this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:22

I literally had a fix ready to test
it was jank as fuck and probably awful
but ready to test
and I went to find the other spike QR's description to copy it
and when I ctrl+F'd for `SPIKE`, I found the OTHER one
and just went `oh. Deedee was here already. Bleh.`

I think it has something to do with the sorting
Because you can manually re-order strings, without changing their index

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 19:38

why, just to organize things better without the screen datas changing?

Yep

One question, is it possible to access a file where you could edit all the strings through an external text editor like notepad?

name is `GetEnemy`
num params is `4`

there is no `GetEnemy` in `functions` so this hits the assert and aborts

an aside, this also causes zquest to abort (it doesn't know what to do when the zscript program just crashes like this)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 00:06

Assuming the QR `Quest->Options->Combo->"Use Warp Return Points Only"` is off, if you're using an arrival square (green) instead of a return square (blue)?

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 00:10

It is off, and I am using the blue return point A

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 00:11

...if it is off, you should be using the green square, not the blue return point
as far as I understand

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 00:15

But wouldn't that assume it should have consistent behaviour between warp types? Because if I use insta-warp in Tile Warp settings, it warps to the correct blue square

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 00:22

I think it's a hardcoded feature of entrance/exit warps

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 00:23

This feels new because it worked before

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 00:26

Could it have something to do with warping to the same DMap (different screen of course)?

you can check it in 2.50.2

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 00:37

I'll check it tomorrow

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 14:46

Oh, so the problem is using Entrance/Exit between two tile warps. It works correctly between a tile warp and side warp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 14:47

...? "Between two tile warps"?
A warp is a warp, what warp you have going the other way shouldn't affect it at all

🤷‍♀️
It's strangely aware

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 14:51

Frankly, my advice is "don't use entrance/exit ever for any reason"

Agreed

=== @ Runa 💜🌸 07/07/2022 08:53

So in builds past 28th of June, scripts break when recompiled in those versions. It compiles without errors, but in-game the scripts do not work. 
Examples: Newbie Boss crashes the game just straight up.
Newbie Item freezes for a second when creating the item, and things like projectile sprite rotation doesn't work at all.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 21:44

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) not ruling out a5 being the cause but this is more likely related to recent zasm opts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/08/2022 21:57

@ Russ (adding to thread)
Is there any error output to the console if it's open?

=== @ Russ 07/08/2022 21:57

Not that I could see. Let me turn on expanded logging though
No script errors printed at least

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/08/2022 21:58

can I have a quest file with an easily reproducable crash?
(I haven't had this happen in any of my recent test quests, so, it isn't just EVERYTHING being broken, it must be something specific)

=== @ Russ 07/08/2022 21:59

Nope. Nothing prints
Sure thing. Give me a bit to get something together

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/08/2022 22:00

thankfully, hard crashes are usually not that hard to track down, because debug mode in MSVC can show exactly where the crash line is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/08/2022 22:01

the thing that confuses me here
is there's only one commit that is likely to be the cause in the timeframe listed
....but, nothing IN that commit looks even remotely suspicious
unless you were calling one of a very small set of functions that *were not documented anywhere* so you wouldn't know they existed to call, but, if you were, that should fail *compile*, not *run*

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/08/2022 22:28

would it be worth posting the lone of code in question

The lone bit of code is an absolutely massive custom subscreen integrated with a whole bunch of global systems, so probably not the easiest thing to do

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/08/2022 22:53

I was referring to the line of code Emily was saying that the debugger stops at

Not a single thing appears related to any of the opcodes altered in this commit: (https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/commit/2da2521062cbd0f9630ebf6d1125d9e232561ff6)

It's crashing on the `insert`
`other->commands` is length `7`
`commands` is capacity `0`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:38

uhg
so
memsetting
does not change the vector's `size`
clearing
does
and by lowering the vector's size
it causes out of bounds errors
fucking everywhere

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:44

try `theVector.assign( theVector.size(), 0 );`
to keep the size
but clear it all
change 0 to the default value of the type tho
hmmm idk if thatd work for value types...

nope
let's see if ```cpp
    auto sz = commands.size();
    commands.resize(0);
    commands.resize(sz);```works

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:47

maybe clear() then reserve(count)?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:47

`reserve` doesn't change size, only capacity

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:47

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:48

and `vector[indx]` is only valid where `indx < size()`, and is invalid where `size() <= indx < capacity()`
`resize()` to 0 and then back up, however, works
at least, it hasn't insta-crashed, and the draws are visible
now to see if it fixed the actual issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:50

nope

When selecting a combo in the FFC editor if you change the palette of the combo then exit, then the combo table in the main screen will shift to that palette.

Recolor can't figure it out either (but maybe there's something wrong with the GIF I exported)

overall the grabbing function appears to be crippled.

=== @ Majora 07/07/2022 17:16

This is definitely broken/anomalous behavior because I have changed nothing about how I import tiles. Used to be able to grab PNGs. Along with BMP and GIF, all 3 formats ZQ would make decent attempts to recolor (or rather the behavior was consistent, vs this off the rails stuff that screams broken, to me)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2022 17:18

`.png` is not in the dropdown list of extensions
(not a new issue, it just, was never added)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 03:31

png for 64 bit is difficult because we are using precompiled binary for libpng that is quite old. Newest libpng is somewhat easy to build but the allegro png addon we are using doesnt work with it. And I could not get the older libpng to build for 64 bits.
I poked at it a bit but didn't get very far. So for now, no png in 64 bit 😦

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 03:34

I have another approach that would be better: use allegro 5's native handling of png and drop the special a4 library that does png. Will try some other time.

=== @ Majora 07/08/2022 03:52

dang, well that's fine. as long as the recoloring function works properly again, format isn't too too important.

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 04:06

tl;dr no 

oh fuck oh god, not yet. was gonna try grabbing random tiles off the DB to see if maybe i just fucked exporting mine or something. also need to make my sprite sheet use exactly 16 colors, but then very slightly change them all, to see if ZC actually CAN color match or if its just completely broken.
after I finish this guy's short quest i'll get on that

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 05:44

I definitely feel like the algorithm/function to match colors changed between allegro 4 and 5. but whatever, file this away. at least regular formats can load in (i.e. the BMP header bytes thing, and PNGs)

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 05:47

## improved tracker file playback (#1507)
@ Mani Kanina opened this issue on 07/08/2022

Status: open

Labels: ['feature']

Source: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/994795833243476068



=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 02:43

I know this is probably a tall order since no one has touched this stuff in ages, but here goes:

I'd like some improvements when it comes to playback of tracker files, what specifically comes to mind for me is .nsf and .gbs, other formats might be applicable too, but I'm less aware of their shortcomings if so.

For .nsf it's just more broad support that is needed. Most widely used expansions aren't supported (FDS, VRC7). Some VRC7 using files run fine though, but most of them don't.  These chipsets were fairly rare when it came to games that used them, but most composers who still make chiptune tracks for the nes/famicom use them. 

For .gbs, it's less of a support matter and more of bad playback. Some files just don't play properly in ZC, missing instruments or having instruments sound widely off compared to the official game.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 03:00

There's been a lot of recent changes to how GME and DUMB (the libraries that plays these formats) are included in ZC. Specifically, we now build the latest versions of them instead of using old ones.

Wait until the next nightly (the latest one has a timer bug that affects music tempo) and give it a spin, let me know if anything has improved. Both libraries have had changes since they were added to ZC, so perhaps there's been some improvement.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 03:02

For anything beyond simply integration (are there formats these libraries support but ZC hasn't used yet?), you'll have to engage with the library developers. For example, for NSF you should talk to the people behind GME. https://bitbucket.org/mpyne/game-music-emu/wiki/Home

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 03:38

Next nightly should hit [#builds-255](https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876906918847852594) in ~20m FYI.

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 13:49

oh, neat
that sounds really good, actually

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 14:14

downloading latest, .nsf files that uses the VRC7 now indexes properly in ZQ, which is nice. They are missing channels during playback, however.
I don't really know what exists
But this music library seems long since discontinued

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 18:03

Right, it's not actively developed but the guy does respond to things occasionally.

Missing channels---does that mean some sounds aren't playing in a track or that there are missing tracks? (I don't know what channel means in this context)

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:06

oh
a channel in the context to music is like... think of an instrument in an orchestra being missing

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:09

A channel is generally limited to one sound wave type, like square wave, etc
so VRC7 tracks play with missing instruments, essentially

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:12

assumedly the not playing ones are the extra channels added by the expansion chip

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:15

Got it. Will you reach out to the GME people about this? If they fix it I can update ZC.

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:15

uh, probably not #socialanxiety

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:16

But there might be better playback libraries that could be used?
idk

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:17

No. That is definitely not an option.

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:17

it seems kinda awkward to go ask them to update in the first place, since it's not the original authors
oh
because of the old architecture ZC uses?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:18

Because no one is crazy enough to support all these formats in one place
Except whoever made this one

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:18

this is true I suppose
and you can't incorporate multiple ones? And be selective which one focuses on what format?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:19

Anyway, the sooner they get a bug report the sooner someone will fix it. Just give me the nsf file that is not working and eventually I'll file a bug

but compare playback of this in other players and in ZC
etc

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:20

It mostly works we aren't gonna toss it out because one format doesn't have support of the enhanced version... We just need to let them know it doesn't work.

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:20

oh that commit is pretty small
when I reverted it, it fixed.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:53

oh, well, that *would* fix it
but also cause other issue
now if you load a long path
close zcl
and reopen
the textbox will be way too BIG

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:54

ok, just rulling out al5. probably not gonna look more into this one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:54

What you could probably do though
is just
add `maxwidth = someamount_px`

ZC has `resx`/`resy` configs. What should happen with the new resizing stuff is, it should ignore these, always using `320x240`; but then resize to the configured value using the new resizing stuff immediately
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
this would fix menus not scaling properly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 02:09

this seems to be working pretty well
i went with 640x420 tho
320x was teeeeeeny

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:09

fair
as long as the menus/dialogs are readable on a high-res monitor, that should do fine

This setting is no longer applying properly to scale the window.

=== @ Orithan 07/22/2022 11:23

The scaling stuff in ZQ does not work on my monitor because I get one of the following:
1) A tiny window at 1x
2) A scrunched up window that my monitor does not properly work with on 2x
3) Irregular pixel size at any sizing between which throws me off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 19:04

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) this would be really good to devote some time to if you have it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/22/2022 19:09

Tell me everything about your monitor and resolution you use
What does scrunched up mean / look like
And does full screen work okay or is that broken for you too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 19:11

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "https://cdn.discordapp.com/at…"): ^This needs to work, is what it comes down to

How it looks can be seen from this link

=== @ Orithan 07/23/2022 07:10

My scaling is 150%, my monitor resolution is 1920x1080
My monitor refresh rate is 60hz

=== @ Orithan 07/23/2022 07:14

Full screen _works_ but not without caveats like it screwing up the window sizes of a lot of other programs that are open because Windows 10 jank

=== @ Russ 07/29/2022 19:26

Ack, sorry for ignoring this. Lemme compare alpha 107 with the newest nightly to show off the issue
ZLauncher 107:

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/995119534581235793/1002658574473908264/unknown.png)
The player, running at the 640x480 setting:

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/995119534581235793/1002658722004348978/unknown.png)
Meanwhile, ZLauncher as of the newest nightly:

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/995119534581235793/1002658829047169164/unknown.png)
The player at the same 640x480 setting:

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/995119534581235793/1002658968113532988/unknown.png)
https://tenor.com/view/small-small-center-zoolander-ben-stiller-ants-gif-5494197
The player can at least be manually resized by dragging the corner now, though it's really obnoxious having to do that every time I start it
The launcher cannot be resized or moved at all, which I think is a separate issue, see here: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1002657953498804316
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "And does full screen work oka…"): Full screen works fine
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Tell me everything about your…"): Gonne refer to the earlier picture I took that Emily linked: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876908472728453161/995053709291688006/unknown.png
The monitor is my laptop's built in monitor. The resolution is 3840x2160. I use that resolution setting in Windows, with the recommended 250% upscaling
Said upscaling seems to be at the heart of the issue here. Pre-A5 builds respected that. Post-A5 builds do not.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2022 19:47

As a work around for now, can you just set the scaling to what you want it to be in z launcher?

Thanks for all the pics I'll look at this eventually

=== @ Russ 07/29/2022 19:53

No, the scaling does not go high enough
The largest setting in Zlauncher is still smaller than the 640x480 size in A4

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2022 23:20

(replying to @ Russ "The player can at least be ma…"): you should be able to adjust `resx`/`resy` manually in zc.cfg
and that should specify the window's starting size
...zcl needs to be updated to handle the new res options
. . . also just got this https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/issues/792

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/01/2022 19:01

*bump*

=== @ Orithan 08/31/2022 23:59

Bump. This is still a very significant issue and drag to scale does not work.

=== @ Orithan 09/01/2022 00:10

Please fix this ASAP. It's entirely screwed up the workflow of myself and multiple others and we cannot work or play quests using these builds until the window scaling is fixed.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/01/2022 03:16

err, I just went to test this @ Orithan
and it looks like ZQ is respecting the windows scaling to me
...it looks the same as just resizing it up, though, it seems?

...frankly, even 125% is too tall for my monitor, lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/01/2022 03:20

but it does appear to be respecting the windows scaling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/01/2022 16:06

@ Russ can you confirm if this is still an issue or not?

=== @ Russ 09/01/2022 16:41

I’ll check when I’m home

=== @ Russ 09/02/2022 10:34

Problem still persists in the newest nightly
Including Zlauncher being unreadable tiny, unresizable, and unmoveable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2022 10:35

yeah, that definitely needs to be fixed....
The windows scaling percentage works for me, though

For FUCKS sake I hate everything
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) adding to thread
So I did a think with the parser so that the github actions could like, y'know, check parsing
....and apparently it caused this to happen
and for the life of me
I have no idea why
everything *looks right*
If the `-unlinked` flag is not supplied, it should behave exactly as it did before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:43

. . . oh, hmm
but
....there appear to be 2 identically named functions, `zconsole_info(const char* format, ...)`
.....wtf
how does that not generate some form of compile error?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 02:45

Why would it? zscript  target doesn't include the other one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:46

Not true
One copy is in `parser.cpp`, for only the zscript target
one copy is in `zscrdata.h`
and `parser.cpp`
has `#include "zscrdata.h"` in it
....changing the version in `zscrdata.h` to be named differently, and changing the reference to it in `zscrdata.h` and `zquest.cpp` to match, has in fact fixed this issue
so, that WAS the issue
I'm just confused as to why the fuck it didn't compile error in MSVC
because that seems like a major problem
OH WAIT
Nevermind
There's an `#ifdef`
which should prevent it
.....but then why the fuck did renaming it FIX THE BUG?


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/995157313574936587/995159681557352529/unknown.png)
those shouldn't be compiled because of that ifndef
but it still
fucking changed it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:53

NO WAIT
I'M FUCKING
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I CLICKED THE WRONG FUCKING FOLDER
OK, that did NOT fix it
I ran the wrong EXE
But
But
It worked in the one I ran
which was built AFTER the last change to the parser
So, is it broken ONLY IN DEBUG?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 02:56

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:58

either with debug builds, or with my debug test folder
but IDK what wrong with my folder could cause THAT

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 02:59

does using zscript on CLI directly work?
or at least print an error

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:59

That works, but that also runs entirely separate blocks of code
or, well, hmm

only thing I can think of is that the quest used to have the "classic header" script crap imported and configured, but I got rid of it for my own script file
so there are a lot of items here that lack their scripts but are still set up equipment
which I assume this scroll: half magic is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:15

I wouldn't see why that would crash anything
the only things that menu reads from items
is their itemclass, name, and `Equipment Item` checkbox
and `Level`, I think, for sorting reasons?
but it shouldn't even be aware of anything else

=== @ Russ 07/09/2022 18:15

In the newest nightly, trying to open the F6 menu sometimes closes ZC. It is inconsistent. There is no "ZC has stopped responding" popup or anything. It just closes.
As F6ing is what people to do in unstable builds to save often to avoid crashes, this one feels pretty high priority

=== @ Moosh 07/09/2022 18:16

Also pretty impossible to pin down. Rainbow death crash is dead. Long live rainbow death crash

=== @ Moosh 07/09/2022 18:24

Had Ether F6 like 20 times in a row and no crash. But we've seen it happen twice on her stream now. She opens the F6 menu, hits Yes, ZC immediately closes with no error message
May be tied to play time or some other thing?

64.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/12/2022 06:27

If you upgrade to latest nightly, when it crashes next I'll get a crash report. That's gonna be the best way to get this fixed.
Since I haven't been able to reproduce myself.

=== @ Ether 07/12/2022 14:06

Understood. If I only move individual files from the update over, is there anything I should be careful not to miss? I notice that only the new one has crashpad_handler.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/12/2022 17:44

crashlad handler is the new thing. All dlls should be copied too. I think that's pretty much it

Got it. I probably won't play again until tomorrow, we'll see what happens then.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/12/2022 17:52

yeah, `.exe` and `.dll` are things that constantly update each build
plus whatever new file was added

=== @ Ether 07/12/2022 17:52

The glitch seems...relatively rare. I abused F6 a ton, probably even more because of the glitch, and across the last two days it triggered three more times, for six times in total.

=== @ Ether 07/12/2022 17:54

I'm on a postgame dungeon of the quest I was streaming, so there's not a whole lot left, but I can try to figure out some excuse to keep going if it doesn't turn up again.

(i'm only testing using ZCL since its the same shit)

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 20:07

**TL;DR: **

Last build before allegro 5 jump: low CPU usage (<1-2%) 

32-bit allegro 5 second release build: low CPU usage (<1-2%

First 64-bit build: elevated CPU usage (~13-15%)
32-bit build accompanying first 64-bit build: elevated CPUusage (~13-15%)

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 20:12

yooooo
out of the gate, ZCL and ZC CPU usage slashed roughly in half
ZQuest about -33% (of previous max) usage. From 30 to 17-22
around 13-15% for ZCL and 11-13% in ZC
big noticeable performance improvement, is the takeaway

On the latest build of ZC for Mac (7/9/22), if I start ZQuest Launcher and change the resolution from the default 640x480 to 1600x1200 and then immediately exit, when I go back in to ZQuest Launcher the resolution will still show 1600x1200. However, if I change the resolution and actually launch ZC Player the next time I start ZQuest Launcher the resolution will have defaulted back to 640x480

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/10/2022 22:37

This is more of a convenience feature.
When configing heart gauge pieces and magic gauge pieces, you only have the visual information based on what's in the quests init data.

Generally for a quest those numbers are far below the final count, so pieces are invisible and makes it hard to see what you're doing when you're editing. This saves a bunch of menuing back and forth in the program.

Either that or a toggle within the subscreen editor to "Display as if 99 hearts/magic pieces" would be convenient, just so you can see all of what you're working with.

and, it's not THAT much of an inconvenience to go to Init Data and set it to a higher number while you're editing your subscreen

Add step-> (could be very useful for sideview) and push-> (for things like old school pushing a door open) to the triggers tab

Also add touch-> (Like the sensitive step that triggers when Link's entire hitbox touches it.)

`Step->`, `Step (sens)->`, `ShutterOpen->`

Along with adding Step (Sens)->next combo types as well.  (Great for crumbling bridge in Z2)

you
would use `Step (sens)->` as the trigger

👏👏👏

there's literally a function called `openshutters()`

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I couldn't reproduce with the…"): I just did, did you move return square A on 3:4F to `y==8`? Because that's when it's acting wacky. I think that quest file has the square on `y==16` because that's where it doesn't act (too) weird

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2022 17:22

Nope, I just ran it as is. I'll try again later.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 01:48

ok yea i see it too. 32 and 64 bit. going back a few nightlies to see when it started

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 01:51

happens in nightly-2022-06-29 too
I'm gonna go get some boba now but will continue looking later. in the meantime, if you happen to see this before I get back: would be helpful to try in some of the older alphas and see if it happens there at all

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 01:54

also i'm assuming it did work at one point... any idea about that? maybe its always been a bug

=== @ vlamart 07/15/2022 03:27

I won't be able to test it tonight, but I always remember never really understanding the behaviour of return squares 😝

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 03:51

I built a couple old versions:

`1fc2c396817 apr 19` happens here

I went back to an older build .. `c986d616f96 mar 20` but it was too old to load the same quest, so I  tried to make it happen in a bare-bones classic quest. I couldn't get it to happen in this version or the newest one using just a stupid basic screen and not changing any QRs or dmap shit. So I can't continue bisecting the issue until I know how to repro it with a simple classic quest...

Any ideas what could matter besides the exact position of Ret square A / warp type being instant?

=== @ vlamart 07/15/2022 03:56

#1501

=== @ vlamart 07/15/2022 03:58

I remember discussing something in here about Entrance/Exit types spawning on (0, 0), but didn't test if this behaviour had to do with where the return square is placed.

=== @ vlamart 07/15/2022 04:00

During these warps, does `Game->Scrolling[dir]` or `Link->Action==LA_SCROLLING` have anything to do with it because I do have a simple script that just pushes the player one tile over if they're scrolling (like how NES dungeons do 2 tiles)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 04:00

I'm changing tactics and just gonna set some breakpoints on the screen transition and see whats up
instead of trying to get multiple old versions of ZC to build on my PC / recreate the issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 04:03

(replying to @ vlamart "During these warps, does `Gam…"): uhhhh
I would HOPE not

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 04:28

Uh can you try without the script

=== @ Majora 07/15/2022 05:23

Oh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 05:32

dont think this is a script thing

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/996950533552214087/997375063626104852/unknown.png)
also this has been here forever
but anyway, imagine y is 0 here. like for your warp. it then goes to -16 for these cave warps
and triggers a transition

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 05:33

Oh ffs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 05:34

This _seems_ like the sort of thing you could just fix w/o a QR?
like surely
no quest relies on this??

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 05:34

Not*that we know of*

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 05:34

like i'm thinking just do a `max(0, ...)` here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 05:36

i guess the idea here is to offset the player a tad if they are spawning onto a cave combo?
dont really get that
I mean, I kinda would get it if it moved the player _down_ but not up
since you typically approach cave combos from the bottom

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 05:38

You typically have the return square 16 px below a cave combo
So it typically moves you up onto the cave combo for the walk animation
I think
Is the idea
Maybe
Too late for brain to brain right now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 05:43

oh wow
So, it does seem like just a visual intent then.
Up to you if you think this needs a QR. lmk  then I'll do it.
or maybe just do it and wait for it to actually seem to break something
idk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 14:28

I think a compat rule would be best
if it broke anything, it would probably be decades old shit we might not hear about for months or years

Dope

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:24

At first I tried to implement this with `std::vector` because that's what I'm familiar with
but, that lacks `pop_front` or `push_front` capability
...and a quick google tells me trying to use that with front access is stupid, and `std::deque` is far better sorted for my needs.
`deque` == `double-ended queue`, so, made for insertion and removal at both ends.
```
/////////////////
///   Stack   ///
/////////////////

long Size;
 * Read-only. The size of the stack, given as a LONG.
 * This means that a stack with 5 items will have a size of '5L'.

bool Full;
 * Read-only. Returns true if the stack cannot hold any more elements.

void Clear();
 * Clears the stack of all elements.

void PushBack(untyped val);
void PushFront(untyped val);
 * Pushes the given value to the back or front of the stack.
 * If the stack is at max capacity, does nothing.

untyped PopBack();
untyped PopFront();
 * Removes the back or front element of the stack, and returns it.
 * If the stack is empty, '0' is returned.

untyped PeekBack();
untyped PeekFront();
 * Returns the back or front element of the stack, without removing it.
 * If the stack is empty, '0' is returned.

untyped Get(long ind);
 * Returns the element at the index 'ind', which is a LONG value.
 * This means that '0L' is the first element, '1L' is the second, etc.
 * If an invalid index is given, '0' is returned.

void Set(long ind, untyped val);
 * Overwrites the element at the index 'ind', which is a LONG value, with the value 'val'.
 * This means that '0L' is the first element, '1L' is the second, etc.
 * If an invalid index is given, nothing happens.

void Free();
 * This will deallocate the stack pointer, so that the pointer ID may be re-used.
 * There is a limit to how many stack pointers may be allocated at once,
 *     so be sure to free them when you are no longer using them.

void Own();
 * Grants 'Ownership' of the pointer to the currently running script.
 * When the script terminates (at the same time any Local Arrays in the script
 *     are cleared), the pointer will be automatically freed.```
I used `long` for the sizing, so, accessing using indexes will be a bit weirder than arrays
but, that means that the max number of elements is `2,147,483,647` instead of `214,748`

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) adding to thread, incase you're interested in what I've done here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:45

Small thing, but I wouldn't call this a stack if you can access front and back. Why not call it Deque since that is what it's wrapping?
Could also just call it Vector, since Deque is a dum name
@TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) did you need a Has method too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:47

Well, `Queue` indicates add-end, read-begin
`Stack` indicates add-end, read-end
....but those are the two commonplace names that would be less likely to confuse people.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:48

I think Array or Vector themselves are pretty generically used across other languages to support both modea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:48

I've only heard `vector` in either a c++ context or linear-algebra context, myself

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:48

Not in cpp tho

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:49

or, P5Js I think I've heard it too, but that's usually referring to an X,Y position/direction vector
which is entirely different

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:50

Ex in Js arrays support both

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:50

I could call it `Array`, but well

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:50

via push, unshift, pop, shift

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:50

having an object called an `Array` that is not the same as `int foo[5];` seems purely confusion-causing
because you can't do ```cpp
int foo[5];
foo->push(1);```
you have to create the special type for it
and use the functions
which is probably why C++ went with `vector` instead
though `vector` in C++ does not handle front-end access
so it isn't even properly comparable to that
Summary being, names are confusing, there are a lot of 'technically' more accurate names, that would be more likely to confuse people, especially given that a lot of people who start using ZScript have no prior coding experience

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:52

C# does List instead but is even more generic (can insert anywhere)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:53

While `list` does sound better
it's a more common word in general
so making that a reserved keyword would be more likely to break old scripts
which is another concern we have to deal with
`switch`/`case`/`default` already did a number on old scripts due to that, though, they are important enough to keep the names they have in most languages
I don't feel like many people likely have variables named `stack` though

-
if an item script calls waitframe() and the quest rule isn't enabled to allow that, the item becomes unusable till you continue.
likely due to trying to wait for the item script to finish before letting you use the item again

=== @ vlamart 07/15/2022 19:47

Maybe as a work around for all the warp wackiness, there just be a Generic Warp type. Flag for if drawn over or under, sensitive or bottom only, "walking down" animation (dir up, cuts sprite off at the top of the combo), "walking up" (dir up, no sprite cutoff), and "walk out" (forces walking from return square). Attribs for forcing return square spawn direction, and the number of frames for the "walk out"

Script:

https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=341

I compiled the script again, which it did perfectly, and then saved the example quest file in the nightly. 

On first run, the first patroller seemingly caught Link fine, I got moved to another screen with the barrel on it. screen 00 to screen 10. 

Then I got caught again on the next screen to the right (screen 01) and ZC froze and the console went apeshit.

the `this->` pointer is broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 04:19

meaning it is not being initialized properly

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:21

I know scripts themselves aren't something to "bug report" on, but my reasoning is to bring attention to changes to ZScript itself, in-engine.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 04:21

I would assume ALL npc scripts would be broken
How was the enemy spawned?

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:23

Oh uh, this isn't a script I wrote or anything. I just asked randomly for recommendations of scripts to test in the latest nightly. This script is yours 😝 not that I'm assuming you'll know everything exactly about a script you wrote 2-3 years ago.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "How was the enemy spawned?"): ^
Did you just place the enemy on the screen normally?
Or use another script?
Or what?
(I didn't actually grab the quest file yet)

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:24

Oh uh, it was the test quest that came with the script. Let me check the setup more

I will tell you that it isn't that ZC is somehow freezing
the script is freezing you until the enemy reaches your position

I have now found out what happens when you have an internal function that has it's name declared, but no code to go inside it
It most certainly *still compiles completely fine* and just acts as though it returns the wrong value
and when you mess with functions that have to do with angles, it might just break scripts that use angular movement....
thank you for narrowing down the versions there @ Majora , or that would have taken me like a week or two to figure out

the internal `RadtoDeg` and `DegtoRad` just had no code

I was just thinking that it would be too complicated in combo stuff. Maybe it would be easier in screen secrets? Instead of like burn or sword trigger tabs, a new ScreenD[] tab, that instead just saves if that combo changes at all (as opposed to how)?

screen secrets are all-or-nothing, either the whole screen triggers or none
stored in a single screen state

so I don't understand what you're trying to say there
the appropriate way to use screen->D

When reading a read-only file display (such as viewing `zstrings.txt` via the `Help` button in the string editor), you cannot type anything; but pressing keys, despite not typing anything, scrolls you to the cursor position. Only the arrow keys should be valid (as they allow you to move the cursor), as well as other scrolling keys such as PgUp/PgDn; any other keys should NOT cause a scroll.

That's right.  I wanna make custom items using the (Non Gameplay Items) dedicated for that purpose other than keys/level specific keys.  The required items in the lock block works.

I have the (Use item and Item required set).  I have the "Held Item" number set corresponding to the item i made and the button I want is assigned to it.  It will not work whether I have the item or not.  That is without all the usable sides checked in the trigger tab because I don't have the "Can't use on sides" checked on the flag tab.
If I check all 4 sides on the trigger tab, it will unlock/open whether I have the item or not.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2022 23:43

the trigger tab has nothing to do with chests

that means chests are using the 2.50.2 code
where none of the new options existed
soooo
I'd uncheck that
and try again
Generally, you never want ANY compat rules enabled when developing a new quest
`Quest->Options->Pick Ruleset Template->Bugfix` disables all of them, with some automatic handling for certain compat rules that need extra steps

=== @ cbailey78 07/18/2022 23:56

It would been useful to use to have multiple locked doors for example Final Fantasy Mystic Quest on the SNES in the focus tower, you have multiple doors to unlock after beating a major dungeon.

=== @ P-Tux7 07/19/2022 04:27

I wonder if there could be a way to circumvent that by designating each chest combo as Normal, Locked, or Boss Locked, *regardless* of its requirements
In other words, think of the flags as Chests 1, 2, and 3, not Normal, Locked, and Boss Locked. Except in compatibility quests.
As we already have all three flags per screen

=== @ P-Tux7 07/19/2022 04:29

And to put three different items in the chest, that could be like the Signpost Combo's checking of strings
0: Special Item (current behaviour)
1-127: X item
-1 - -8: Screen->D[] 0-7
Mind if I make that as a feature suggestion?

I think this might be a bit of a big request, but it would be very helpful if there were built in functions to keep track of things like the previous screen the player was on, the previous map, their previous position, etc. I'm not sure how comprehensive this should be, but at the very least the things I listed would help immensely with screen-related scripts.

=== @ P-Tux7 07/17/2022 20:43

Do note how clunky it is to keep track of these things manually with a header too. Having a big array you have to index with a bunch of constants that are all equivalent to specific functions or variables is crusty in my humble opinion!

It's not terribly difficult to but unironically having to be like `if(MISC[GLOBAL_PREVIOUS_DMAP] != Game-GetCurDMap()){//blah}` or whatever is clunky
I don't remember if that's the proper name for the function on the right but that's not really the point
The generic scripts thingy sounds helpful admittedly
but the necessary naming schema for arrays and constants for this kind of stuff isn't very conducive to actually using them imo

This would flag the item as being dropped by the given NPC UID, where you can do things involving it like referencing the NPC's ItemSet and doing drops based off that.
For non-NPC drops, they can be -1.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2022 07:57

if it's dropped by the enemy, then the enemy no longer exists, so how are you going to reference it's pointer?
Or do you mean `ID` rather than `UID`?

Either that and/or a way to just reference the enemy's dropset it had at the time

The built in movement functions can clip enemies into solid objects under certain circumstances with the ``Sprite Coordinates are Floats`` quest rule, which makes collision checks a headache.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/998792373167464458/998792435377373284/zc_screen00008.png)
The two numbers in the top right corner tracks the enemy's position.

=== @ Orithan 07/19/2022 03:27

By having the angle be weird values at the top of the screen with this function I was able to clip it into solid objects:
``this->MoveAtAngle(angle, this->Step/100, SPW_NONE);``
The NPC has a step speed of 300

The following CanMove check always returns false regardless of what angle is input:
``this->CanMoveAtAngle(ang, 1, 0)``

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:12

Would this occur with normal ghost?
because, I literally copied ghost's code pretty much

=== @ Orithan 07/21/2022 01:09

I think what's happening is the collision check is counting subpixels. If the collision check clips into a solid object by subpixels it's still counted as collided. The movement functions can clip them into solid objects by subpixel amounts and then some weird shenanigans can clip them a full pixel into the object and cause issues that way

=== @ Orithan 07/21/2022 01:10

Because I'm also seeing a lot of instances where NPCs get stuck running along the edges of walls using walk functions.

=== @ Orithan 07/22/2022 02:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "because, I literally copied g…"): Looking into Ghost's code, I can be certain it was not written to account for floating point sprite positions

I know combo cycling is a thing, but would also be convenient if `Timer->` (with a box to put in number of frames) were a trigger. Especilly with the new combo effects

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2022 20:25

hmmm, that's a really good idea
similar to Button it isn't just a checkbox, so not as easy to add as checkboxes
but good idea

=== @ vlamart 07/19/2022 20:26

Is it time for a Triggers 2 tab? 😝

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/19/2022 21:01

Can you elaborate what the timer would like, be timing? I'm just curious.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2022 21:02

like, combo triggers itself every N frames

## Tag Chest Combo as Normal, Locked, or Boss Locked (#1554)

=== @ P-Tux7 07/20/2022 00:18

This would make it possible to have three treasure chests of any requirement on the screen. Multiple chests on one screen is very common in the official Zelda games and this addition would not only make quests feel more authentic to Zelda, but encourage users to play around more with the new more authentic chest options already added, such as costs, button prompts, and Hookshottability. I can also see some fun potential with the three Chest Copycat combos now that it would be easier to trigger all three different kinds on one screen.

New combo attribute: Flag used
Normal
Locked
Boss Locked

New combo attribute: Item inside
0: Special Item
1-128: Specific Item ID -1
-1 - -8: ScreenD 0 to 7 read as Specific Item ID

This also would result in the Screen State Carryover menu having the names changed to Chest 1, Chest 2, and Chest 3, and the Locked Chest and Boss Locked Chest combos' names being changed to indicate their deprecated necessity.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 23:32

The problem here is, grabbing the item from one chest would make the item not be in the other chests
since that uses the screen's special item state
so once you grab one, the other chests become empty
unless screen states were expanded to handle this better, but, that's a quest size / memory eater to expand, so not likely to happen

I'm using a sprite decoration sfx.  I'm gonna show you the results in the player that it shows cset 0.

err...
how does the combo
change
I don't care about the explosion effect

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:18

I'm using secret combo flags

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:18

ok
make sure
that you set the secret combo
in the secret combos menu
to the correct cset

I'm gonna show you the results in the player.
hang tight...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:19

show me the secret combo setup in ZQ
because that's 99% what's wrong

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:21

I'm using the "transition" combos for the explosion sprite effects than cycles to the broken blocks.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:21

ahk, so it's a cycle
show me the combo cycle setup then

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:22

Here is the results.

yeah doesn't matter
you said it was wrong cset seeing it doesn't help
the zq setup is all I need to see

k, that looks right, so the cycle is the problem

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:24

the two blocks are the "always triggered" for the explosion sprite.  Then it cycles to cset 0 whether I have "cycle ignores cset" on or not.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:24

screenshot of the cycle setup is all I need to tell you exactly what's wrong
oh?
Even with cycle ignores cset?
That's odd
can I please
see the setup

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:25

ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:26

so, that combo is the one that it turns into after the secret?
and cycle ignores cset DOESN'T work?
because that's exactly what I would suspect is wrong here

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:26

I'll test the ignore once more...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:27

I added that checkbox specifically for this situation
if it doesn't work then there's a bigger issue here somewhere

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:27

It doesn't work with the ignore cset on as well.
When I leave the screen and go back, it shows the correct cset I want it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:27

can I have the quest file?
...what???
You're using the `Skip cycle on screen init` flag, I presume?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:30

...OH, I think I see the issue

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:30

Ok, I turned off the "Cycle combo on screen init" and it will stay at cset 0 and replay the sprite decoration fx on screen re-entry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:32

All I did was replace the one you uploaded over the old zelda.exe.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:36

err
were you using 32bit or 64bit

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:36

I was using the 64 bit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:36

bleh
I don't build 64bit
the only way to get 64bit is to push through github and run it's build script for 30 minutes
or I need to set up an entire second buildchain
....probably simplest if you grab the latest 32 bit build, and add the exe I gave to that

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:37

ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:37

(...I really NEED to get a 64bit chain set up, which shouldn't be that hard, just, time consuming)

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:39

I only see the 64 and 86 bit for the windows version in Github.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:39

`x86` is not `86 bit`, it's `32 bit`
...why, I have no clue

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:39

Ok.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:40

`x86 architecture` is just the thing that runs `32 bit`
...always confused me

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:43

...err
according to my prints
nothing is combo cycling at all there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:53

. . .
Unchecking `Trigger Singular Secret` fixes it
but
it still doesn't
trace anything
so it's still NOT cycling?
what the fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:56

....oh
you're using the `->Next` trigger
so yeah, this has absolutely nothing to do with cycling
because you aren't using cycling
at all
The `Trigger Singular Secret` is NOT something you want checked here
because that's replacing the combo with a secret combo of some sort
the only reason it isn't blanking out completely to combo 0
is because `->Next` overrides the combo ID back to normal

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:57

Unchecking singular secret fixed for me. thanks so much for your time, you are so helpful!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:58

Doing JUST that also stops the SFX from playing though
You want to use `Change Combo` on the generic combo
*INSTEAD* of the `->Next` trigger flag

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:58

Yeah, but when I check "Change combo" It give back the SFX.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:58

yeah, exactly
`Change Combo` does `->Next` for you
so you don't need `->Next` checked
....`Generic` combos are a damn mess

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) if you…"): I mean, deleting them would be a lot cleaner....
but also break quests that used them

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 22:35

I am so glad that generic combos got implemented. I unlocks so much flexibility and potential.  If it weren't for generic combotype, we would get bombarded with feature requests.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:47

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:48

bush combos, for example, will always be triggered by sword regardless, so if you want a bush that does the bush effects but isn't cut by the sword, you can't with a bush, but you *can* with a generic combo

You can make bushes not cut by sword
now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:50

what the fuck
okay
can you do custom breaking effects like Generic combos could?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:50

yep, bushes have had that for quite a while

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:50

do they *work* though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:51

pretty damn sure they do
it's the same code as generics use

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:51

hmm
okay, what else is unique to generic combos...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:52

spawning enemies
offhand, that's unique
...won't be once I add armos combotype effects though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:53

Triggers don't have a flag to kill the weapon when it triggers it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:54

That's fair, should add that
good idea

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:56

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...won't be once I add armos…"): you also wouldn't be able to mix and match, say, a grass cutting effect with an enemy spawn
(for enemies hiding under bushes)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:57

true
could add that to bushes
fairly easily

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:59

On one hand, a feature complete triggers tab could just completely deprecate bushes and flowers and tall grass
on the other, it's not as user friendly to do so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:59

Things that aren't checkboxes in triggers take extra memory on combos
we have room for >30 more checkboxes without expansion, though
thus far buttons, item required, and timer added 3 bytes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 23:01

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "You can make bushes not cut b…"): this also affects all combo types that 'trigger' on their own

because

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/999415134835441674/999415205232652298/unknown.png)
those are some weird file names
Any chance you could get that to say `Compiling the buffer` instead?
Used to always be `Compiling 'tmp'`, which, was more understandable than a giant path to a temp folder

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:46

It uses the os temp file convention
Also, can't you make this change how you like it? It's very simple
Just ... Don't print the file name

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:47


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/999415134835441674/999417388229472276/unknown.png)
well that

the top one, yeah, duh, that's simple enough to change
but the error messages, not so simple

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:51

Ain't no one editing in the buffer
Or if they are bless their souls

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:52

I use the buffer for pretty much every test quest
so

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:52

How?
Say more
Like just to include afile?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:52


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/999415134835441674/999418574034698270/unknown.png)
All of that was edited in the buffer

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:53

Ok, but why?

Wouldn't you rather have a set of real test scripts on disk somewhere not saved in random quest files

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:53

Sometimes the test script hardcodedly references things in the quest file
so it would be useless outside of that file
and, depending on what I'm doing, I could go through several of these test files in a day
I don't really need to double the number of files cluttering my ZC folder by saving all of those externally

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:55

so, in short, no I would rather not

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:56

Is have the name buffer in the temp file good enough
Otherwise...this whole compiler probably works directly with file paths so changing that for one type of input is probably difficult? But also something I'm not familiar with atm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:57

It would be much better if it could just replace the file name with `buffer` for the temp file
though including the word buffer would be better than it is now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:58

Well, that's something I know I could do in a minute.
The other thing idk

It was already hardcoding that check
actually this should probably be easy

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:59

Well there you go ez peasy
Just set a global or something if it is from the buffer
Because the exact path will differ based on OS

I don't know if it's possible to add, but I came up an idea ti have an item that changes a Dmap palette. Like the "Z2 candle" that you obtain in the first palace to illumite the caves, so you can see.  Have a "candle palette" in the dmap settings.

very possible with scripts
not sure if worth adding an itemclass for

We should put in a directional buttons check boxes in the triggered tab for the warp combo types which is useful for making doorways for sideview gravity screens/map that you press UP to warp like in SMB3.

so IDK how that'd work

=== @ P-Tux7 07/21/2022 04:51

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and how would that work with…"): Presumably whenever the "up" key is detected as being pressed? (Walking up, left-up, right-up, etc.)

Labels: ['bug']

=== @ vlamart 07/22/2022 01:26

If you set `timer->` and cycle timer to 29 (1 or 0 frames), it works as expected. However, if cycle timer is also set to 30, after the combo cycles once, if it is cycled to again, it only lasts a frame or couple and sometimes even just fails to cycle.

=== @ vlamart 07/22/2022 01:29

(Tested on two blocks switching colors every 30 frames, A switches back and forth using the timer and `->Next`/`->Prev`, and B uses `Timer->Next`, but uses combo cycling to go back)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 01:35

fek

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 19:42

Oh, for fucks
You know what it is @ vlamart ?
Cycling is based on combo animation
So the cycle timer keeps playing even while the combo isn't on screen
And `Reset animation when cycled to`?
That resets the combo animation when it is CYCLED to
Not when it appears by any other means
So there are probably a ton of other ways to cause this
and, it's just because of *how cycling works*
I would call this "Not a bug"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 19:46

The timer is working exactly as intended, which is nice
Cycling is just doing what cycling has always done, which is weird jank, but it's how it works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 19:47

Ahk, couple things
1. `Reset Anim`
If checked, then after being triggered, the animation of whatever combo is at the position is reset
(So, if the combo changes, the new combo resets its' animation; which fixes the cycling weirdness)
2. `Combo Change`
I removed `->Next` and `->Prev` entirely
now it's just a textbox
old quests will populate the field based on the old flags appropriately

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 20:41

This COULD break scripts that used the flags via script, but, <:nekoshrug:869489800271503400> they can update

Need to add script access to ALL of the new shit, though
`combo change` has a range of `-65535` to `65535` for the record
which, `65280` is max combo
so

```
int TriggerItem;
 * The required item ID for triggering the combo.
 * If 0, no item is required.

int TriggerTimer;
 * The timer for timed combo triggers. If 0, no timed trigger will occur.
 * The combo will be triggered every 'n' frames, timer unique to each combo position.

int TriggerSFX;
 * The SFX to play when the combo is triggered. If 0, no SFX will be played.

int TriggerChange;
 * The amount the combo will change by when triggered.
 * Ex. '1' acts as '->Next', '-1' acts as '->Prev'.
 * If '0', no change occurs.```

so all ZC knows is that `KEY_3_PAD` was pressed

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/23/2022 00:03

It would be nice if raising something to an exponent had it's own operator. I propose `**` since a couple of programming languages already use that, and it's less clunky than having to call `Pow()` for such a basic math operation.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/23/2022 03:59

If I were to add that, it wouldn't be good for rewrite, because `*` is used for pointers
and, like, `a ** b` could then mean `a to the b power` OR `a times (what b points to)`
so, meh
powers also, while you may call them a basic math operation, are NOT generally a basic code operation

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/23/2022 04:41

I am skeptical as to how rare of an operation it is in languages, but the ambiguity on the end of the parser makes a lot of sense.

=== @ Alucard648 07/23/2022 08:40

In most programming languages ^ is exponential operator, so A^2 is ewual to A*A .

Currently, config files are included with each new alpha or nightly, and you have to specifically not include it if you don't want to have to rebind your controls or reset certain settings (such as the level palette fix). Instead of including it, maybe it could be generated when you load up ZQuest or ZC and a config isn't already found.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2022 01:09

Yeah, the problem is the one deedee reported here
the new download contains default `.cfg`s
so you need to specifically not overwrite yours with those

ahhh
thanks, I think I get it. I tend to overcomplicate things lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2022 07:08

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) so, this isn't set up completely
What you would need to do (and notably, I am not doing it)
is replace every `get_config_int`, `get_config_string`, `get_config_float` with `zc_get_config`
(the params don't change, only the function name)
that'll make sure that when it tries to read the config, it writes it back to the file if needed
thus generating the file
Once you've done that, you can remove the configs from `output/config`

## Move ComboScreenCombo Flag Enemies to Game Settings (#1575)

Source: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1001602363414560809



=== @ P-Tux7 07/26/2022 21:30

Currently, the following enemies, which are spawned by combos, screen flags or combo flags:
-Shooter (Fireball)
-Armos
-Ghini 2 (Phantom)
-Rock
-Zora
-Trap (4-way Line of Sight)
-Trap (Vertical Line of Sight)
-Trap (Vertical Continuous)
-Trap (Horizontal Line of Sight)
-Trap (Horizontal Continuous)
are set via checking the relevant flag in the Enemy Editor, and the enemy with the lowest ID that has said flag is spawned when said combo/screen/flag calls for it.

My proposal is to convert these settings to a 0-511 number in Game Settings/GameData that is both settable in ZQuest (in a "default enemies" tab in Game Settings) and readable/writable via ZScript (for difficulty modes). When loading old quests, the enemy flags will be read and then converted to GameData. This is even easier for pre-2.50 quests because the IDs of said enemies in those quests are consistent and were unchangeable.

With this done, this should leave **ten general-use flags** on **every** enemy.

I'd also like to request the enemy IDs of the Projectile-Shooting Fires that flank Guys and Zelda Room Fires to be settable in this menu, too. Currently, they use hardcoded enemy ID numbers.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2022 06:25

Firstly, can't be 0-255, max enemies is 511
Secondly, could 2.50.2 ZScript interact with those flags in any way? If so, this simply can't be added until rewrite
Thirdly, that sounds like a lot of work, so even if 1. and 2. are not problems, it won't likely happen any time soon

=== @ P-Tux7 07/29/2022 06:34

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Thirdly, that sounds like a l…"): Yeah well you never know these days. I figured it'd be a good idea to ask due to it presenting you more ZScript possibilities, Deedee because it involves enemy code, or if Connor happens to get the idea in his head as he is wont to do

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Secondly, could 2.50.2 ZScrip…"): @ HeroOfFireZC was that a thing? I wasn't really thinking it could; I recall reading the .qst NPC data or an NPC's current flags to be rather limited in 2.50 and it seems unlikely anyone would have thought to make these read/writable
Sorry for the ping, I figured you were the person here who mucked with modifying Zoras, statues, traps, and whatnot at runtime.

From the latest version added on the evening of July 27th.

I just successfully compiled a script,  (Emily's Screen State assignment script she graciously provided for assigning strings to signposts.  Thanks again!)  and then went to assign it to a slot in the "Screen" tab, because I seem to think that's where it should go, (and it let me.) 

... and then when I hit The [ OK ] button, the Zelda 2 fanfare theme played, ... ...

... ... ... ...

and then, it seemed to just freeze.  Nothing happened.  Not even the cursor can move.

But I CAN hit enter to make things proceed.  Assuming I knew to do that.

So I guess there's a window somewhere that appears after hitting [ OK ] that doesn't quite move to the foreground to be seen, is all.

Hop into the Combo Alias editor.  Create a new Alias.  Click the "Org" button.  Keep "Copy" selected, and find an alias with layer 0 and layer 3 checked.

Copy that Alias to a new Alias slot.

Note how even though Layer 3 was active on the source Alias, the Destination Alias doesn't have layer 3 enabled __until__ you click the Properties button.

"Weapon Dir" can only make a spawned weapon move, there's no option for standing still, like you might want a bomb explosion to do. So please make it so that 0 makes it stand still and 1-8 are the other directions, and 9+ is random direction. Basically shift all the current numbers up by one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2022 06:22

no, that won't work
because the dir numbers are the dir numbers, same exact numbers used everywhere relating to direction
Nothing is actually wrong with the dir
the problem is that there's no place to specify the *Speed*
being able to specify a speed is a major thing missing anyway, and a speed of 0 gives you the effect you are missing
Also, even a weapon that does not move, has a dir
so, speed as an attrishort or attribute, is what needs to be added

=== @ Russ 07/29/2022 19:24

As of the newest nightly, both 32 and 64 bit builds, the launcher window cannot be moved like a regular window and cannot be resized. Additional, due to the ongoing Windows Scaling Issues (https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/995119534581235793), the unmoveable window is so tiny as to be barely useable

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2022 19:49

Yeah it's cuz I removed the frame from the window ... So we'd either need to revert that change, or make it so that the title bar that z GUI draws knows how to move the real window
Really don't want to do that second bit so I'll probably just revert it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2022 19:51

Oh another option is to also remove the title bar that z launcher draws to fix the original issue I had here... Is that two title bars look weird

=== @ FireSeraphim 07/31/2022 13:43

I kinda wish ZLauncher could be minimized to the bar. It currently lack a minimize button and that kinda doesn't help since I have ZLauncher pinned to my taskbar and when I launch it there it doesn't properly show up on as a tab on the taskbar. It works otherwise but that's kinda jank and bad

This is kinda a frivolous suggestion but I remember there being rooms in in ALTTP with multiple unlit torches and each torch lit up in those rooms brighten up those room progressively.

=== @ vlamart 08/28/2022 17:43

Let's make generic combo type even more redundant and add `Spawn Sprite` and `Spawn Enemy` too (double whammy, enemies busting out of pots. Triple bonus, busting out of pots via proximity)

=== @ vlamart 08/28/2022 17:52

And `Spawn Item`:
0 > Dropset
0 <= specific Item
(Onus will be on quest maker to set the item flag for Special Item, for the item itself to only ever spawn once, I would assume same with enemies)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/28/2022 17:54

(replying to @ vlamart "And `Spawn Item`:
0 > Dropset…"): If the special item were not built in, it *wouldn't prevent the item spawn*

=== @ vlamart 08/28/2022 17:56

Oop, my next idea was to make it a check box, then if checked, the number box will un-grey. Then:
0 = Special Item
0 > Dropset
0 < specific Item

=== @ vlamart 08/29/2022 20:59

Also make `Secrets->Next` obsolete/redundant

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 12:20

`Spawn Item`
`Spawn Enemy`
`Enemies->`,`Secrets->`
`Trigger Copycat`
`Change CSet`
`ExState`

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 12:59

Also `Spawn Sprite` like smashing a pot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 13:05

bleh, you can probably just use one of the types that spawns sprites when broken

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 13:32

Then instead, maybe someway of adding the `Combo Change` value to `ComboType Effects` (or a new checkbox)? (E.g., slash grass, `+3` instead of just `next`)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 13:33

you... can already do that
just use the generic combo change
and combo type effects
the generic combo change takes priority if enabled

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 13:34

Oh, dope cool, then never mind 😊

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 13:37

basically, `combotype effects` is the first effect to occur
and change combo/change cset, store the combo ID before anything changes, and then use that for their change

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 13:55

Doprah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 13:56

OK, currently building a first test, which includes:
`CSet Change`
`Spawn Item` + (special item flag)
`Spawn Enemy`
`ExState` (linking the combo triggering to a screen ExState[] value)

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 13:58

Is it only triggered by `ExState[]`, or can it trigger an `ExState[]` too? (I guess that would be more appropriate for the `Switch` combo type)

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 13:59

Never mind, just remembered triggering `ExStates[]` is already a thing, and is in fact _the thing_

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 14:00

(replying to @ vlamart "Is it only triggered by `ExSt…"): It would trigger an ExState
and if that ExState is already triggered, the combo will trigger ONLY it's 'Combo Change' and 'CSet Change' attributes (i.e. won't do combotype effects, spawn item, spawn enemy, etc)
so, it's effectively an 'only trigger once' effect
It has a flag to not trigger the exstate until the spawned item is collected or the spawned enemy is killed, as well
so you can tie the behavior to the item or enemy itself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 14:04

Also, using this, you can change the exstate behavior of say, a lockblock, to do `+3` instead of `->Next`
as the generic exstate takes priority over the combo-specific exstate

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 14:44

bwahhahahaha
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "OK, currently building a firs…"): ^All works
That just leaves...
`Enemies->`
`Secrets->`
`Trigger Copycat`

OK, `Copycat` works perfectly

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 16:21

Can you do conditional effects via scripting, like
```if(triggered by sword) combo change+1
else if(triggered by arrow) combo change+2```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 16:40

=== @ vlamart 09/02/2022 13:46

Another effect for redundancy, `Cooldown Timer`, a number box where the combo isn't able to be triggered until time is up (could also just be a check box or negative value that changes the timer behaviour)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2022 13:52

that's way too smart an idea
(sounds good, though nightly is already mid-post so not today)

=== @ vlamart 09/02/2022 13:55

Also, the kill weapon flag would still apply during the cooldown

Since light beams don't draw fast enough to trigger the combo until after scrolling, it would be nice to add a flag and attrib for the `Light Trigger Combo Type` for a trigger delay (if unlit, n frames lit until triggered; if lit, n frames unlit until untriggered)

Come to think of it, this might be related to the other earlier issue I reported a while back with the palette thing.

Anyway, on EU keyboards, alt + number keys produces symbols.

In the build I'm sitting on, which is admittedly over a month old now, ZQ's string editor does not take this input anymore.

We don't get the information of what key combo you've pressed
so if you type an `@` on that layout (`Alt+2`)
all we get is `KEY_2`,`alt`
and would need to parse that, somehow, into `@`....

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/02/2022 18:28

it's weird
because this stuff evidently worked on older allegro
because I had no issue with the string editor in older ZC versions

Palette Importing from images is broken. The first image is what the palette in the edited screenshot looks like in ASEsprite. The second image is what ZC reads from the image and I know I haven't updated ASEsprite and it worked fine in previous versions of ZC, so the problem has to be on ZC's side.

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/04/2022 09:12

@EmilyV99 (discord: EmilyV) The problem here being that ZC isn't reading the palette correctly when in did in previous versions. I use ASEsprite as a shortcut to editing and making new palettes for ZC and I don't know what has happened on the palette importer side of things but it's simply not reading the palette correctly now.

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/04/2022 09:16

also, I had to use an editor screenshot because non-editor screenshots don't preserve the internal colour index structure when used. In previous 2.50 derived versions of ZC (probably prior to the allergo 5 migration) this wasn't a problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/05/2022 08:05

Making general text combos handle that will.... not be as easy
The script editor already had copy+paste functionality
just, you could only paste things that you had copied from the script editor itself, and you could only paste things you copied from it to other parts of the script editor
so, I just made those calls use the system clipboard instead
other things have no handling for more than one character being entered at a time
or for highlighting multiple letters at once to copy

In Yuurand specifically, lock blocks on layer 2 no longer work on the newest nightly. They work in alpha 107. Per jman, the new lockblock logic no longer checks on layers. The old lock block collision rule should be enabled automatically for older quests, preserving the old behaviour, but this does not seem to be happening
Relevant conversation snippit
11:31 PM] jman2050: yeah I'm looking at the github
[11:32 PM] jman2050: looks like Emily overhauled lock blocks (among other things) about three weeks ago, then set up a quest rule if the old behavior is wanted
[11:32 PM] jman2050: notably, in the new logic it doesn't check for layers at all
[11:32 PM] jman2050: as far as I can tell
[11:33 PM] jman2050: the old function checks for valid lock block combos on layers 0,1, and 2 as was standard
[11:33 PM] Russ: Ah...
[11:33 PM] Russ: Okay, then lemme just go ahead and make a bug report for this right now
[11:34 PM] jman2050: for now, just setting that quest rule on should fix any issues with Yuurand 
[11:34 PM] Russ: Which rule?
[11:34 PM] jman2050: it's called Old Lockbock Collision or something like that
[11:34 PM] jman2050: it's a quest rule
[11:34 PM] Russ: Wait, is this a new 2.55 rule?
[11:34 PM] Russ: Yuurand's saved in 2.53, so that rule SHOULD be set by default when it's played in 2.55 
[11:35 PM] Russ: So the issue might be that that rule is not being properly set for older quests
[11:35 PM] jman2050: possibly
[11:35 PM] jman2050: still, having certain combo behaviors on layers 0-2 can be useful, so this should be evaluated anyhow
[11:35 PM] jman2050: as far as the new behavior goes

there's an off-by-one error

It's a gb style lock door

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/10/2022 23:34

so, it's using a lockblock combo type, is what I am asking?
you can't just tell me what it is from a design perspective, you need to say what you are actually USING to do that in order for it to be useful information for a bug report
My guess is, it's a lockblock on a layer
which I just fixed a bug with like, 2 days ago
if it isn't a lockblock combo on a layer, then this is a separate issue; but I need to know that to be able to do anything about it

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007073702158028961/1010105785122029578/unknown.png)
notice notably that the mouse cursor is not visible on the left edge of the screen here
....this is NOT using an actual hardware cursor, which would be better
but, I made an ALLEGRO_EVENT_QUEUE listening for the A5 events 'mouse leave display' and 'mouse enter display'
....and then use those events to call the *A4* function `show_mouse(NULL)`/`show_mouse(screen)` to show/hide it.
```cpp
static ALLEGRO_EVENT_QUEUE* evq = nullptr;
void init_mouse_events()
{
    if(!evq)
    {
        evq = al_create_event_queue();
        al_register_event_source(evq, al_get_mouse_event_source());
    }
}
void update_mouse_events()
{
    if(evq)
    {
        ALLEGRO_EVENT event;
        while(al_get_next_event(evq, &event))
        {
            switch(event.type)
            {
                case ALLEGRO_EVENT_MOUSE_ENTER_DISPLAY:
                {
                    show_mouse(screen);
                    break;
                }
                case ALLEGRO_EVENT_MOUSE_LEAVE_DISPLAY:
                {
                    show_mouse(NULL);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
void destroy_mouse_events()
{
    if(evq)
    {
        al_destroy_event_queue(evq);
        evq = nullptr;
    }
}```
looks about like it used to look before the A5 update

It would be neat if screen messages could be displayed at negative Y coordinates and appear on top of the passive subscreen, so you could have the text window replace the passive subscreen. (Not sure how this would interact with layer 6/7 stuff, as the "passive subscreen above sprites" rule creates layer 7.)
Also if I posted this before and forgot, I apologize

Adding negative values to counter pick-ups (for things like Rupoors). Maybe also adding negative values to the combo editor's Skip.X and Y, as well as A.Frames (to move backwards in a tileset, e.g. -2 on tile 5, would animate 5, 4, 3)

If I set this to a negative and hit OK, it becomes 0

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/14/2022 03:49

How is that wacky?
An item on-screen should be moveable, right? It's certainly what you would hope happens in ZC when it comes to scripting moving items.
Though if you mean moved by off-screen conveyors then yeah that's wacky as I described above

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/16/2022 01:39

this is intentional so that conveyors pushing items off the screen continue to push the item entirely off the screen despite the item only checking it's center

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 08/14/2022 16:07

If you have an FFC on a screen set to run on Screen Init, the script is delayed during the opening wipe after loading the quest from the file menu. This means updates to the screen, such as combos or Screen->Item do not occur until the wipe is finished.
This means the combo update will not appear during the wipe, and Screen->Item occurs too late if the Item is already spawned.
The FFC script runs fine after an F6 Continue. Only the opening wipe from loading the quest has this delay.
As this has worked this way since 2.52, this will need a compatibility QR.

Just a random brain fart idea I had the other day, I figured I'd post it:

When setting a screens layer, include an option to configure X/Y scrolling speed for it. so, with, say. -0.5x, it would move one pixel to the right every other frame. Layers would loop in on itself.

You can already do these kind of draws with scripts, but for moving backgrounds or foregrounds this could be handy.
say a floating sky area, you could have a layer dedicated to a moving clouds BG.
or fog as an overhead layer
Basically it would be a utility feature for non-scripters. But I have no clue how hard this would be to add, so.

When testing a light puzzle and resetting ZC, the previous light beams are still drawn a few frames after the test is restarted, even on a different screen. The beams also seem to delay being drawn about the same amount of frames when the screen scrolls. Meaning if a trigger relies on light beams, it gets retriggered when entering that screen before it finishes loading

## Relative positioning for the -message more- icon instead of absolute positioning (#1611)

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/19/2022 13:57

It's probably a minor thing (maybe not considering the message more icon was a 2.10 feature and that was before there was the ability to have message boxes bigger than 32 pixels tall) but basically the "message more" icon/ press A button to continue prompt for message boxes current use absolute positioning which is not ideal because sometimes I run into situation where I have a big 64x64 message box and the message more prompt ends up inside the box instead of beneath it. What I would like to propose is a new QR called "Message More prompts use relative positioning instead of absolute positioning" which fixes this lingering problem
I can give you a screenshot or two which demonstrates why having a relative positioning option for the message more prompt would be ideal.

that's a very odd crash point

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 04:57

well it's memory corruption
so something before this
but after compiling
I've actually seen this a couple times
It happened kinda rarely. I just ignored and soldiered on.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 04:58

I'm assuming the `d_keyboard_proc` there is the `y` shortcut to open the compile dialog
...which is absolutely of no help
`refresh` is drawing the entire main UI, usually
though takes a flagset for what parts to redraw

then
which deals with my `acquire_screen` bullshit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:04

Wait, may want to ignore that. I think that may have been the first-ish nightly with crash reporting.
Hard to tell.
But, that does seem related...
given that is in the stack
and it being rare = related to mutexes/threading

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:05

the prior nightly was the same day, and the alpha that added crash reporting was a couple days prior
so, could be coincidence, buuuut
and those commits are directly messing with the compile dialog, too, so
it's a bit *too* coincidental
I have no idea what would be wrong, though
at least commit narrowing was easy....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:10

that right there probably is the issue lines
the other 3 changes that are not on those lines don't seem likely, as one was whitespace and the other 2 only would occur if you clicked the `Script Info` or `Clear Slots` popup buttons
so it almost HAS to be that....

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:24

What should I expect to break without the `sp_*` functions?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:25

they are just calling `acquire_screen`/`release_screen`
so, preventing draw flickering, IIRC?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:26

Not seeing any flickering without them.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:27

also be sure that the `Script Info` and `Clear` buttons work
and that the popup telling you how long assign slots took, actually, is like, visible

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:28

yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:28

ah, right
the flickering was on the `<<` button
that assigns a slot
because, it closes the dialog, and re-opens it
but, it should never close, visually; it should not draw while closed there
because that flickers the dialog out and back in, which looks weird AF

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:28

OK, I do see that.
on <<

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:29

that's what it was fixing
if you can fix that in any other way, feel free

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:29

Yes, I'll look into that.
B/c the crash is happening as we modify the screen var while not owning the lock
which is bad cuz the display thread will invalidate that memory often
so all the lock releasing/unreleasing has to be the issue
but i understand why you did it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:30

What I did appeared to be exactly the way to handle this
so I am confused why it is having any issues
is this not like, the exact point of acquire/release screen?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:48

hmm yeah it does seem like the code wouldn't mess up the locking behavior...may I've gotten unlucky but I was able to repro the crash with the sp_ calls, but not without, so it really could be related...


Anyway, we can avoid the flickering by just avoiding drawing to the screen bitmap directly as some of these dialog methods do. Should be equivalent to draw to non-screen bitmap, then blit that onto the screen in one go at the end. No lock juggling, and blits are atomic (b/c when the dest bitmap is the screen it acquires the lock for us)
So I'll do that, and hopefully that works and we can remove the extra lock complexity. maybe that fixes it. at the least it'll reduce some complexity.
(ex: in `popup_zqdialog`)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:49

the problem is actually the blit at the end of `popup_zqdialog`
which restores the background behind the dialog
realistically, if the dialog is being re-opened, that draw needs to never reach the actual screen, because it should not be seen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:50

ahhh
ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:51

....but, it needs to be done, because when `popup_zqdialog` is called again, it uses that to create the backup to restore, which while we don't want it when the dialog is re-opening, we *DO* need when the dialog is actually closing
the main problem here being how old dialogs work; they close entirely when you click a button, then do something based on the button, then re-open
instead of having code in the dialog to handle the button
This was never an issue before, as the screen did not EVER update, except when `update_hw_screen()` was called
so, since that was never called in any of those button-handling codes, it never displayed that flicker
but switching to a draw thread, it's just completely not designed to handle it
this issue would occur in basically *every single old dialog*
though assign slots was *particularly* annoying and you click the buttons a lot there

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:52

soooo we can maintain a recursive "in old gui" counter and decide not to do that second blit when we are not the root call?
same thing just without mutexes?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:53

what do you mean `root call`?
there's no recursion

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:53

ugh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:53

the dialog handler function
calls popup_zqdialog
then after the dialog closes, it handles some code
then re-opens the dialog fresh
...the best thing I could think of, is to split up what `popup_zqdialog` is doing
so, have a function call that blits the entire screen to some temp bitmap, and another that restores that temp bitmap to the screen
and then call those NOT in the dialog popup function, but, outside in the main handler function
that way, it won't ever do that 'restore' unless the dialog is ACTUALLY closing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:58

something like this

i did that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:08

err, but the start call there... does the actual `do_zqdialog`
how is that working on the other side?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:09

Ah, I'm just calling the start thing each iteration lol
i'll break it up more

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:09

you shouldn't need 3 separate things
you should just need to add a start and end
and replace the popup call with `do_zqdialog` itself
the only reason that MSG_START and MSG_DRAW were there, is so the dialog would draw before the screen release call
which was an absolute hack

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:10

Oh, don't need those? Thats why I was gonna do a third fn
but if we can drop
cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:11

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1010366294111043704/1010430919632486420/unknown.png)
this is what I was going to do
just cache the whole damn screen so it doesn't need the dialog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:13

which, also seems to work perfectly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:22

but I see no fix for what that was acquiring for

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1010366294111043704/1010433817691041862/unknown.png)
these 3 had nothing to do with the dialog you fixed
should revert that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:23

Quest rules?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:23

...these also can't be fixed in the same way, because these are new dialogs, so don't use any form of popup function
though they also weren't crashing
I get the feeling it was the `object_message(MSG_DRAW)` that was causing the crash
which, these didn't use
so, in other words, 1 of 3 places that used the sp_ functions was bugged
you shouldn't have removed them from all 3
just the 1

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:26

What guis are these though?
I want to verify it's needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:26

`Quest->Options` and `Quest->ZInfo`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:27

i clicked all the buttons in those
seems good
ah
found one
ok
kk reverting that bit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:28

the `load` button in `zinfo` dialog
and the `Ruleset`/`Rule Template` buttons in the QR dialog
and load qr string as well
all of those require re-generating the entire dialog, so they would have flickering without an acquire

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:20

which reminds me, I wonder if `std::vector` in mapscr (which was an aspirational thing) has any noticeable overhead
i'll try replacing with a static array and see if I noticed a better uncapped fps

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:21

yeah, it has no reason to be a vector
even if it doesn't have much overhead, reverting it to an array is probably sensible
HAHAHAHHAHA
SUCCESS
Now any dialog can just set
`rerun_dlg = true;`
before exiting
and it will automatically re-open, BEFORE the end call
the only thing that won't be regenerated is anything in the constructor of the dialog
so, the 2 dialogs that needed this, I just moved a couple things from the constructor to the view() function
so that they will be re-called
and viola, no more sp_bullshit needed for anything
....gonna leave those functions there in case they are needed in the future, though
```cpp
static std::vector<BITMAP*> zqdialog_tmp_bmps;
void popup_zqdialog_start()
{
    BITMAP* tmp_bmp = create_bitmap_ex(8, zq_screen_w, zq_screen_h);
    
    if(tmp_bmp)
    {
        scare_mouse();
        blit(screen, tmp_bmp, 0, 0, 0, 0, zq_screen_w, zq_screen_h);
        unscare_mouse();
        zqdialog_tmp_bmps.push_back(tmp_bmp);
    }
    else
    {
        *allegro_errno = ENOMEM;
    }
}

void popup_zqdialog_end()
{
    if (zqdialog_tmp_bmps.size())
    {
        BITMAP* tmp_bmp = zqdialog_tmp_bmps.back();
        scare_mouse();
        blit(tmp_bmp, screen, 0, 0, 0, 0, zq_screen_w, zq_screen_h);
        unscare_mouse();
        destroy_bitmap(tmp_bmp);
        zqdialog_tmp_bmps.pop_back();
    }
    position_mouse_z(0);
}```
so, these now do the whole screen, don't take any params, and vector-store multiple bitmaps

=== @ Tabletpillow 08/20/2022 02:02

If an item was spawned from the CreateItemAt(); script and the ruleset 'Hold Up Items' is checked through the screen data, Link still doesn't hold up the item.

=== @ Tabletpillow 08/20/2022 02:03

The item is picked up but there is no animation
Even with the ruleset checked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 02:21

That'd be correct
you need to set the spawned item to hold on pickup
the screen flag is only for items placed on the screen normally via zquest
```cpp
itemsprite spr = CreateItemAt(id, x, y);
spr->Pickup |= IP_HOLDUP;```

I see, but it wasn't always like this right?
Since the GB chest script for example I noticed that some quests that used it in the past could be affected by that.
But the script itself could be edited to allow pickups at least.

It seems like the shutter door sfx that plays when you unlock blocks aren't playing. Instead you just get silence.

Is this a new lockblock that you just set up, or one from a tileset?
If you just set it up, you need to set the sound yourself in the attributes, now
lockblock combos in existing quests should have it autofilled to the door sfx
but, creating new ones you need to set it

In the title bar of the application (all 3), would it be possible to add the pixel size of the window. Not the window + bar/border, just what ZC/ZQ is displaying. Since they can be dynamically resized and all. To facilitate recording, was what I was thinking as basis for this.

checkbox on crystal switches / switch blocks: `uses global state`, uses one of 32 global states instead of one of 32 level-dependant states

checkbox on crystal switches (reqs global state) `set revert timer`, gives attribute option for `revert timer`, a number of frames before the switch reverts itself. Only works on global states.

generic trigger option: byte `Switch State` (pick a state 0 to 31), checkboxes `Global State`, `Trigger when on`, `Trigger when off`. `Global state` works the same as it does on switches, changing what state is being read. The triggers do as they say, triggering based on that state.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 02:29

so, like, ```
int bitmap->CountColor(bitmap mask, int x, int y, int checkColor, int maskColor);
 * Checks the area of the bitmap specified by the mask for the specified color.
 * If 'maskColor' is '-1', any non-0 portion of the mask bitmap will be checked. Otherwise, only areas of the mask bitmap that match the maskColor will be checked.
 * The area checked is from `x,y` to `x+mask->Width,y+mask->Height`. If this goes out of bounds, the out of bounds area is ignored.
 * As this is not a drawing function, draws that occur this frame will *NOT* be read- only whatever was drawn to the bitmap at the end of the previous frame will.```

The Warp Doll Item Script here: https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=102 softlocks the game if the item has a circular animation.

=== @ Tabletpillow 08/21/2022 10:15

Wait. I think this problem is only present in my quest.
That's really odd, since I don't remember making any changes to the script.

=== @ Tabletpillow 08/21/2022 10:20

Well this is the line in my quest script for the circle animation. Wondering if there's anything wrong with the code.

## weird mouse scaling issue (#1621)

it barely caught it visibly in the video, sadly, as it's such a small flicker
it's most visible right near the end
while moving the mouse, it occasionally flickers out, and appears slightly off to the side; this occurs whenever there are black bars due to resizing not to scale, such as when maximizing.
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
something is not quite drawing the mouse at the right position, but only occasionally, and only for approximately a frame before flickering back to the correct place.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 18:59

Does it happen without that recent mouse hide change
The mouse is meant to be drawn in the larger Fullscreen viewport and stretched into the smaller fake canvas thing we have rn
Hence it doesn't line up
It works ok when you can't see the real mouse lol
This may become simpler/go away with hardware mouse so should try that first before getting to deep on this bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 19:09

yeah, hardware mouse is probably the solution

## 🔓ZC Launcher isn't loading alternate saves correctly (#1622)

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/22/2022 20:52

So I basically have two instances of zc.sav, one named zc_play.sav (this file is for when I want to play other quests and it's in a "saves" folders I made) and zc.sav (I use the later to test Myriad Worlds in the actual ZC Player from start to finish) and when I tell ZC Launcher to load zc_play.sav for save files it basically ignores it and defaults back to loading zc.sav for save files. This problem didn't exist a month or so ago.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2022 21:38

`and it's in a "saves" folders I made`
did you direct it to the folder properly?
oh, wait, it's not typed in, it's a browser
huh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2022 21:42

....the launcher is setting the config properly
ZC just appears to be resetting the config

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2022 21:47

I.... this is a tangled mess of a poorly implemented feature... I don't have the energy to dig into this right now
(you can take one guess who's feature this was....)

## GSwitch-setting SCCs (#1623)

This would be super useful to have combos change in other rooms after viewing strings such as in cutscenes, NPC dialogue, or wordless invisible strings. This is practically a game-wide event flag system and non-script access to it would make for some revolutionary quests, as seen by TabletPillow's use of Screen State Carryover and dummy item checks in quests like Link: Rank 9, The Glory Squad, and The Rosemaster. Those are some of the most dynamically changing through the game quests I've seen, really like a real Zelda game does, and making this new GSwitch technology easier to use would result in some more great ones.

In the same group of checkboxes as transparent, add `Overhead` (follows same rules as flag (or type, I don't remember), only on layers 0-2)

Similar to a statue. Good for 2.10 bosses with combo-cycling, moving FFCs, or booby trapped Next combos or secret combos. This can be seen as an in-engine and extended version of the Timed Shooter FFC script. The benefits are that this is less random than statues, there is no statue enemy to hurt Link for a non-solid shooter, and it can move as an FFC unlike statue enemies. It really helps with some danmaku boss ideas and room hazard ideas I had for my current project idea.

Attributes
-EWeapon
-Angle:
--0-360: A constant degree
-- -1: Aimed at Link in 4-way
-- -2: Aimed at Link in 8-way
-- -3: Aimed perfectly at Link
-Shot Type (like walking enemies)
-Shot Speed
-Shot Sprite
-Shot Rate Constant Rate/Lower Random Range
-Shot Rate Upper Random Range
-Minimum Player Distance (in pixels)

Flags:
-Random (the shooting timer is constant. The upper random range attribute is used in this configuration. If not set to random, the Lower Random Range attribute is used as a constant timer.)
-Spawn Weapon Immediately Upon Existing
-Requires Minimum Player Distance (like the Z1 statues, it will not fire if the player is close enough. Uses the attribute above)
-Is Boss-Level Projectile

=== @ Shane 08/31/2022 21:30

Oh this would be awesome.

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 09/01/2022 09:51

It's all anyone's ever wanted regarding projectiles.
... and non-scripting phobias.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2022 10:28

ok god dammit p-tux you requested a lot here
pretty fancy request, not easy to fill
.....and yet, I have *most* of it done
(I didn't add shot types or a boss fireball checkbox)
(but shooting single weapons seems to work perfectly)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2022 13:37

ahk, it's done
it can shoot multiple weapons, with whatever arc between them you like
can shoot boss fireballs with a checkbox
can use the unblockable flags
can attach a weapon script (by ID number) to its' spawned weapons

=== @ Tsunami Tommy Reload the Shotty 09/02/2022 13:44

... you're a madwoman.  Can't wait to test that out.  Thank you so much!  This really puts non-scripted custom bosses ahead by ten steps.

i've just jumped up to the newest nightly from b107, and i was wondering why some of my enhanced music wasn't playing? 
first screenshot is the newest nightly, and the second is from 107.

i have another gbs file in the quest as well but it works fine. 🤷🏻‍♂️
